					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>OBJECTIVE: To offer a practical demonstration of receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, diagnostic efficiency 
statistics, and their application to clinical decision making using a 
popular parent checklist to assess for potential mood disorder.
METHOD: Secondary analyses of data from 589 families seeking outpatient 
mental health services, completing the Child Behavior Checklist and 
semi-structured diagnostic interviews.
RESULTS: Internalizing Problems raw scores discriminated mood disorders 
significantly better than did age- and gender-normed T scores, or an 
Affective Problems score. Internalizing scores &lt;8 had a diagnostic 
likelihood ratio &lt;0.3, and scores &gt;30 had a diagnostic likelihood 
ratio of 7.4.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates a series of steps in defining a 
clinical problem, operationalizing it, selecting a valid study design, 
and using ROC analyses to generate statistics that support clinical 
decisions. The ROC framework offers important advantages for clinical 
interpretation. Appendices include sample scripts using SPSS and R to 
check assumptions and conduct ROC analyses.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as
 crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the
 highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex
 models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or 
deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and 
interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been 
proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but 
it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is
 preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified 
framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive 
exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a 
particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the 
identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, 
and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this 
class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six 
existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class 
lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this 
unification, we present new methods that show improved computational 
performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous
 approaches.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Psychological constructs, such as negative affect and 
substance use cravings that closely predict relapse, show substantial 
intra-individual day-to-day variability. This intra-individual 
variability of relevant psychological states combined with the “one day 
of a time” nature of sustained abstinence warrant a day-to-day 
investigation of substance use recovery. This study examines day-to-day 
associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco 
use among 30 college students in 12-step recovery from drug and alcohol 
addictions. To account for individual variability in day-to-day process,
 it applies an idiographic approach. The sample of 20 males and 10 
females (mean age = 21) was drawn from members of a collegiate recovery 
community at a large university. Data were collected with end-of-day 
data collections taking place over an average of 26.7 days. First-order 
vector autoregression models were fit to each individual predicting 
daily levels of substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use
 from the same three variables one day prior. Individual model results 
demonstrated substantial inter-individual differences in 
intra-individual recovery process. Based on estimates from individual 
models, cluster analyses were used to group individuals into two 
homogeneous subgroups. Group comparisons demonstrate distinct patterns 
in the day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative 
affect, and tobacco use, suggesting the importance of idiographic 
approaches to recovery management and that the potential value of 
focusing on negative affect or tobacco use as prevention targets depends
 on idiosyncratic processes.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Smoking cessation is an important public health policy 
worldwide. However, as far as we know, there is a lack of screening of 
variables related to the success of therapeutic intervention (STI) in 
Brazilian smokers by machine learning (ML) algorithms. To address this 
gap in the literature, we evaluated the ability of eight ML algorithms 
to correctly predict the STI in Brazilian smokers who were treated at a 
smoking cessation program in Brazil between 2006 and 2017. The dataset 
was composed of 12 variables and the efficacies of the algorithms were 
measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value (PPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. 
We plotted a decision tree flowchart and also measured the odds ratio 
(OR) between each independent variable and the outcome, and the 
importance of the variable for the best model based on PPV. The mean 
global values for the metrics described above were, respectively, 
0.675±0.028, 0.803±0.078, 0.485±0.146, 0.705±0.035 and 0.680±0.033. 
Supporting vector machines performed the best algorithm with a PPV of 
0.726±0.031. Smoking cessation drug use was the roof of decision tree 
with OR of 4.42 and importance of variable of 100.00. Increase in the 
number of relapses also promoted a positive outcome, while higher 
consumption of cigarettes resulted in the opposite. In summary, the best
 model predicted 72.6% of positive outcomes correctly. Smoking cessation
 drug use and higher number of relapses contributed to quit smoking, 
while higher consumption of cigarettes showed the opposite effect. There
 are important strategies to reduce the number of smokers and increase 
STI by increasing services and drug treatment for smokers.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Winner of the 2014 Technometrics Ziegel Prize for Outstanding 
BookApplied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling 
process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data 
splitting and foundations of model tuning.&nbsp; The text then provides 
intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and 
classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and 
solving real data problems.&nbsp; Addressing practical concerns extends 
beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, 
selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model 
performance―all of which are problems that occur frequently in 
practice.&nbsp;The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process 
through many hands-on, real-life examples.&nbsp; And every chapter 
contains extensive R code for each step of the process.&nbsp; The data 
sets and corresponding code are available in the book's companion 
AppliedPredictiveModeling R package, which is freely available on the 
CRAN archive.&nbsp;This multi-purpose text can be used as an 
introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a 
practitioner's reference handbook, or as a text for advanced 
undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses.&nbsp; To 
that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the 
covered concepts and uses data available in the book's R 
package.&nbsp;Readers and students interested in implementing the 
methods should have some basic knowledge of R.&nbsp; And a handful of 
the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The digital world is generating data at a staggering and still
 increasing rate. While these ‘Big Data’ have unlocked novel 
opportunities to understand public health, they hold still greater 
potential for research and practice. This review explores several key 
issues arising around big data. First, we propose a taxonomy of sources 
of big data in order to clarify terminology and identify threads common 
across some subtypes of big data. Next, we consider common public health
 research and practice uses for big data, including surveillance, 
hypothesis-generating research, and causal inference, while exploring 
the role that machine learning may play in each use. We then consider 
the ethical implications of the big data revolution with particular 
emphasis on maintaining appropriate care for privacy in a world in which
 technology is rapidly changing social norms regarding the need for (and
 even the meaning of) privacy. Finally, we make suggestions regarding 
structuring teams and training to succeed in working with big data in 
research and practice.</td>

 use of both big data and machine learning rely on understanding several
 key limitations of each. First, we observe that machine learning’s 
capacity to overcome the curse of dimensionality requires tall data 
sets.(43) Small and/or biased training sets can lead to overfitting 
(Table 2) which limits the problems that current machine learning 
methods can address. Second, machine learning models are often described
 as “black boxes” whose opacity precludes interpretability or 
sanity-checking of key assumptions by non-experts. (109) While recent 
work has partially addressed this limitation (Sidebar 4),the problem 
persists. Third, in some instances, observers assume that models that 
learn automatically from data are more objective therefore more accurate
 than human-constructed models. Although data-driven models frequently 
can predict outcomes better than theory-driven models, data-driven model
 building also involves subjective decisions, such as choice of training
 and evaluation data sets, choice of pre-processing criteria, and choice
 of learning algorithms and initial parameters. These decisions 
cumulatively result in biases”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FTYCJ52WS%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23843%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22The%20digital%20world%20is%20generating%20data%20at%20a%20staggering%20and%20still%20increasing%20rate.%20While%20these%20%E2%80%98Big%20Data%E2%80%99%20have%20unlocked%20novel%20opportunities%20to%20understand%20public%20health%2C%20they%20hold%20still%20greater%20potential%20for%20research%20and%20practice.%20This%20review%20explores%20several%20key%20issues%20arising%20around%20big%20data.%20First%2C%20we%20propose%20a%20taxonomy%20of%20sources%20of%20big%20data%20in%20order%20to%20clarify%20terminology%20and%20identify%20threads%20common%20across%20some%20subtypes%20of%20big%20data.%20Next%2C%20we%20consider%20common%20public%20health%20research%20and%20practice%20uses%20for%20big%20data%2C%20including%20surveillance%2C%20hypothesis-generating%20research%2C%20and%20causal%20inference%2C%20while%20exploring%20the%20role%20that%20machine%20learning%20may%20play%20in%20each%20use.%20We%20then%20consider%20the%20ethical%20implications%20of%20the%20big%20data%20revolution%20with%20particular%20emphasis%20on%20maintaining%20appropriate%20care%20for%20privacy%20in%20a%20world%20in%20which%20technology%20is%20rapidly%20changing%20social%20norms%20regarding%20the%20need%20for%20(and%20even%20the%20meaning%20of)%20privacy.%20Finally%2C%20we%20make%20suggestions%20regarding%20structuring%20teams%20and%20training%20to%20succeed%20in%20working%20with%20big%20data%20in%20research%20and%20practice.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20review%20of%20public%20health%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-publhealth-040617-014208%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%220163-7525%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Annu%20Rev%20Public%20Health%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22PMID%3A%2029261408%5CnPMCID%3A%20PMC6394411%22%2C%22page%22%3A%2295-112%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22PubMed%20Central%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Big%20Data%20in%20Public%20Health%3A%20Terminology%2C%20Machine%20Learning%2C%20and%20Privacy%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Big%20Data%20in%20Public%20Health%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Mooney%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Stephen%20J%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Pejaver%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Vikas%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222018%22%2C4%2C1%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22mooneyBigDataPublic2018%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Mooney and Pejaver, 2018, p. 8</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>INTRODUCTION: Smoking lapses after the quit date often lead to
 full relapse. To inform the development of real time, tailored lapse 
prevention support, we used observational data from a popular smoking 
cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to 
distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports.
AIMS AND METHODS: We used data from app users with ≥20 unprompted data 
entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, 
activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level 
supervised machine learning algorithms (eg, Random Forest, XGBoost) were
 trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample 
(1) observations and (2) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of 
individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested.
RESULTS: Participants (N = 791) provided 37 002 data entries (7.6% 
lapses). The best-performing group-level algorithm had an area under the
 receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.961 to 0.978). Its ability to classify lapses for 
out-of-sample individuals ranged from poor to excellent (AUC = 
0.482-1.000). Individual-level algorithms could be constructed for 
39/791 participants with sufficient data, with a median AUC of 0.938 
(range: 0.518-1.000). Hybrid algorithms could be constructed for 184/791
 participants and had a median AUC of 0.825 (range: 0.375-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Using unprompted app data appeared feasible for 
constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification 
algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen 
individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual's dataset, in 
addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of 
each individual's data, had improved performance but could only be 
constructed for a minority of participants.
IMPLICATIONS: This study used routinely collected data from a popular 
smartphone app to train and test a series of supervised machine learning
 algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse events. Although a 
high-performing group-level algorithm was developed, it had variable 
performance when applied to new, unseen individuals. Individual-level 
and hybrid algorithms had somewhat greater performance but could not be 
constructed for all participants because of the lack of variability in 
the outcome measure. Triangulation of results with those from a prompted
 study design is recommended prior to intervention development, with 
real-world lapse prediction likely requiring a balance between 
unprompted and prompted app data.</td>

<p>a few notes about their methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
they are not predicting into the future - they are essentially looking at associations
</li>
<li>
they did not participant-group in CV so one participant's observations could be in training and test
</li>
<li>
it is unclear how they are evaluating their models out-of-sample (i 
think their primary evaluation is done in validation, i.e., where 
they're also selecting) but they report additional OOS statistics
</li>
<li>
i am confused by how they selected their analytic sample
</li>
<li>
data were user-generated EMAs within an app rather than prompted EMAs, 
so many individuals had 100% lapse rates (i.e., seemed to use the app 
only when they had a lapse to report rather than more generally)
</li>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background
We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and 
regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art 
methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable 
for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we 
describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and 
increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of 
the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of 
previously infeasible approaches.

Methods
We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold 
cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, 
and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model 
assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define
 two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double 
cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated 
grid-search in the general case.

Results
We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation 
of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different
 splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken 
into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression 
models.

Conclusions
We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when 
selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating 
nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction 
recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing
 triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or “moderators”) may 
participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when 
participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to 
continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the 
scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. Objective: 
Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to 
engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are 
struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational 
linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to 
successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that 
moderators find most concerning. Methods: Training data came from a 
trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in 
recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling 
discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned 
problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these 
messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a 
Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and 
Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most 
important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and 
Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers 
leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support 
vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers
 were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support 
intervention. Results: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the 
Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including 
words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (“drink,” 
“relapse,” “depression,” and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and 
Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, 
affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as 
well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features
 from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed 
best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, 
achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of 
patients in recovery. Conclusions: Differences in language use can 
distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message 
types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use 
allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff 
may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive 
issues.  [J Med Internet Res 2018;20(6):e10136]</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Predictors for success in smoking cessation have been studied,
 but a prediction model capable of providing a success rate for each 
patient attempting to quit smoking is still lacking. The aim of this 
study is to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms 
to predict the outcome of smoking cessation. Data was acquired from 
patients underwent smoking cessation program at one medical center in 
Northern Taiwan. A total of 4875 enrollments fulfilled our inclusion 
criteria. Models with artificial neural network (ANN), support vector 
machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest 
neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and naïve 
Bayes (NB) were trained to predict the final smoking status of the 
patients in a six-month period. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and 
area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC or ROC 
value) were used to determine the performance of the models. We adopted 
the ANN model which reached a slightly better performance, with a 
sensitivity of 0.704, a specificity of 0.567, an accuracy of 0.640, and 
an ROC value of 0.660 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.617–0.702) for 
prediction in smoking cessation outcome. A predictive model for smoking 
cessation was constructed. The model could aid in providing the 
predicted success rate for all smokers. It also had the potential to 
achieve personalized and precision medicine for treatment of smoking 
cessation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background and aims In smoking treatment trials comparing 
varenicline with transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), 
stratified by nicotine metabolite (3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) ratio 
(NMR), the relative benefit of varenicline is greater among normal 
rather than slow metabolizers. This study tested if the relative 
effectiveness of varenicline and NRT is associated with NMR status in a 
natural treatment setting. A secondary aim was to test if this 
relationship is moderated by behavioural support. Design Prospective 
observational multi-centre study with 4-week and 52-week follow-up. 
Setting Nine English Stop Smoking Services (SSS). Participants Data came
 from 1556 smokers (aged ≥ 16 years) attending SSS between March 2012 
and March 2013. Interventions Participants received pharmacotherapy 
together with behavioural support. Measurements The primary outcome was 
carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence at both follow-up times. 
Main explanatory variables were (1) NMR status [slow (NMR &lt; 0.31, n =
 451) versus normal (NMR ≥ 0.31, n = 1105) metabolizers]; (2) 
pharmacotherapy (varenicline versus NRT) and (3) behavioural support 
(individual versus group-based treatment). Analyses adjusted for 
baseline socio-demographic, SSS, mental/physical health and smoking 
characteristics. Findings Of participants, 44.2% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) = 41.7–46.6%] and 8.0% (95% CI = 6.8–9.5%) were 
continuously abstinent at 4 and 52 weeks. Varenicline was more effective
 than NRT at 4 weeks (P &lt; 0.001) but only marginally so at 52 weeks 
(P = 0.061). There was no or inclusive evidence that NMR status 
moderated relative efficacy of varenicline and NRT at 4- [P = 0.60, 
Bayes factor (BF) = 0.25] or 52-week follow-ups (P = 0.74, BF = 0.73). 
However, this relationship was moderated by behavioural support (p = 
0.012): the relative benefit of varenicline over NRT at 52-week 
follow-up was greater in slow, not normal, metabolizers receiving group 
rather than individual support (P = 0.012). Conclusions In a real-world 
setting, the nicotine metabolite ratio status of treatment-seeking 
smokers does not appear to contribute substantially to the differential 
effectiveness of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in Stop 
Smoking Services, when both pharmacotherapy and behavioural support are 
self-selected.</td>

 performance. A variety of example data sets are used to illustrate the 
techniques along with R programs for reproducing the results.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have 
established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not 
provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently
 faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that 
addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely 
confront treatment teams.

Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation
 were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to 
clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, 
which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE 
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) 
approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the
 strength of recommendations.

Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and 
two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. 
Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine 
patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather
 than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, 
initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and 
using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than
 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine 
patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using 
varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes.

Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple 
practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of 
tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.</td>

recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, 
using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a
 nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, 
initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and 
using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than
 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Around 19% of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, and smoking 
remains the leading avoidable cause of death in this country. Without 
treatment only ~5% of smokers who try to quit achieve long-term 
abstinence, but evidence-based cessation treatment increases this figure
 to 10-30%. The process of smoking cessation comprises different 
pragmatically defined phases, and these can help guide smoking treatment
 development and evaluation. This review evaluates the effectiveness of 
smoking interventions for smokers who are unwilling to make a quit 
attempt (Motivation Phase), who are willing to make a quit attempt 
(Cessation Phase), who have recently quit (Maintenance Phase), and who 
have recently relapsed (Relapse Recovery Phase). Multiple effective 
treatments exist for some phases (Cessation), but not others (Relapse 
Recovery). A chronic care approach to treating smoking requires 
effective interventions for every phase, especially interventions that 
exert complementary effects both within and across phases, and that can 
be disseminated broadly and cost-effectively.</td>

 researchers now view tobacco dependence as a chronic disease (Fiore et 
al 2008). Most smokers need to make repeated quit attempts before 
quitting permanently, and this realization has led to chronic care 
models of smoking intervention (e.g., Joseph et al 2011). Such models 
build in contingencies for patients who relapse and offer appropriate 
ongoing care to smokers regardless of their willingness to quit or where
 they are in the quitting process (e.g., recently quit or relapsed).”</span> <span class="citation"

 who are 2 to 3 weeks into a quit attempt may have experienced the worst
 of withdrawal, but clearly they still face challenges that often derail
 their abstinence. The leading threats include: decreased self-efficacy 
(especially after lapses: Gwaltney et al 2009, Kirchner et al 2012); the
 premature cessation of either medication or counseling (Tonstad et al 
2006); poor medication adherence (Stapleton et al 1995); frequent 
exposure to smoking cues (Loh et al 2012, Shiffman et al 1996b); and 
unexpected exacerbations of withdrawal craving that may occur weeks 
after the quit day (Piasecki et al 2003). How these events unfold as a 
process is not yet clear. What is clear is that smoking a cigarette 
after the quit day starts a cascade of events that typically progresses 
to full relapse, including a plunge in self-efficacy, demoralization and
 withdrawal from treatment.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FX8AC85LB%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A24148%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Around%2019%25%20of%20U.S.%20adults%20smoke%20cigarettes%2C%20and%20smoking%20remains%20the%20leading%20avoidable%20cause%20of%20death%20in%20this%20country.%20Without%20treatment%20only%20~5%25%20of%20smokers%20who%20try%20to%20quit%20achieve%20long-term%20abstinence%2C%20but%20evidence-based%20cessation%20treatment%20increases%20this%20figure%20to%2010-30%25.%20The%20process%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20comprises%20different%20pragmatically%20defined%20phases%2C%20and%20these%20can%20help%20guide%20smoking%20treatment%20development%20and%20evaluation.%20This%20review%20evaluates%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20smoking%20interventions%20for%20smokers%20who%20are%20unwilling%20to%20make%20a%20quit%20attempt%20(Motivation%20Phase)%2C%20who%20are%20willing%20to%20make%20a%20quit%20attempt%20(Cessation%20Phase)%2C%20who%20have%20recently%20quit%20(Maintenance%20Phase)%2C%20and%20who%20have%20recently%20relapsed%20(Relapse%20Recovery%20Phase).%20Multiple%20effective%20treatments%20exist%20for%20some%20phases%20(Cessation)%2C%20but%20not%20others%20(Relapse%20Recovery).%20A%20chronic%20care%20approach%20to%20treating%20smoking%20requires%20effective%20interventions%20for%20every%20phase%2C%20especially%20interventions%20that%20exert%20complementary%20effects%20both%20within%20and%20across%20phases%2C%20and%20that%20can%20be%20disseminated%20broadly%20and%20cost-effectively.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20review%20of%20clinical%20psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050212-185602%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221548-5943%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Annu%20Rev%20Clin%20Psychol%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22PMID%3A%2023297788%5CnPMCID%3A%20PMC5844577%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22675-702%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22PubMed%20Central%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Interventions%20for%20Tobacco%20Smoking%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%229%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Schlam%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Tanya%20R.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Baker%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Timothy%20B.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222013%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 16</span>)</span> CRITICAL FOR WHY IT MATTERS A LOT TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS IN FIRST FEW WEEKS</p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FW88M4NKM%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22X4VYEHHJ%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ff6666%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B150%2C719.42%2C517.17%2C730.58%5D%2C%5B150%2C705.42%2C499.8%2C716.58%5D%2C%5B150%2C691.42%2C494.33%2C702.58%5D%2C%5B150%2C677.42%2C358.28%2C688.58%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FX8AC85LB%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D">“Multiple

 crucial question that deserves further research is the nature of the 
treatment goal that recently relapsed smokers should be encouraged to 
pursue. The traditional goal of most relapse recovery treatments is that
 the smoker make an immediate new quit attempt. However, this approach 
may put too much pressure on a smoker whose confidence and selfefficacy 
have been shaken. The alternative, as manifested in the Joseph study 
(Joseph et al 2011), is to encourage relapsed smokers to adopt a smoking
 reduction goal—including using smoking medication and behavioral 
training to limit the amount they smoke (e.g., substituting smoking 
medication for cigarettes, eliminating smoking in key contexts). This 
strategy could be considered either a long-term harm reduction strategy 
(although the extent to which smoking reduction decreases harm is not 
known; Hughes &amp; Carpenter 2006); or a transitional stage leading to a
 new quit attempt at a later point in time”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FX8AC85LB%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A24148%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Around%2019%25%20of%20U.S.%20adults%20smoke%20cigarettes%2C%20and%20smoking%20remains%20the%20leading%20avoidable%20cause%20of%20death%20in%20this%20country.%20Without%20treatment%20only%20~5%25%20of%20smokers%20who%20try%20to%20quit%20achieve%20long-term%20abstinence%2C%20but%20evidence-based%20cessation%20treatment%20increases%20this%20figure%20to%2010-30%25.%20The%20process%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20comprises%20different%20pragmatically%20defined%20phases%2C%20and%20these%20can%20help%20guide%20smoking%20treatment%20development%20and%20evaluation.%20This%20review%20evaluates%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20smoking%20interventions%20for%20smokers%20who%20are%20unwilling%20to%20make%20a%20quit%20attempt%20(Motivation%20Phase)%2C%20who%20are%20willing%20to%20make%20a%20quit%20attempt%20(Cessation%20Phase)%2C%20who%20have%20recently%20quit%20(Maintenance%20Phase)%2C%20and%20who%20have%20recently%20relapsed%20(Relapse%20Recovery%20Phase).%20Multiple%20effective%20treatments%20exist%20for%20some%20phases%20(Cessation)%2C%20but%20not%20others%20(Relapse%20Recovery).%20A%20chronic%20care%20approach%20to%20treating%20smoking%20requires%20effective%20interventions%20for%20every%20phase%2C%20especially%20interventions%20that%20exert%20complementary%20effects%20both%20within%20and%20across%20phases%2C%20and%20that%20can%20be%20disseminated%20broadly%20and%20cost-effectively.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20review%20of%20clinical%20psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050212-185602%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221548-5943%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Annu%20Rev%20Clin%20Psychol%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22PMID%3A%2023297788%5CnPMCID%3A%20PMC5844577%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22675-702%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22PubMed%20Central%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Interventions%20for%20Tobacco%20Smoking%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%229%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Schlam%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Tanya%20R.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Baker%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Timothy%20B.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222013%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 20</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The growing availability of data and computing power fuels the
 development of predictive models. In order to ensure the safe and 
effective functioning of such models, we need methods for exploration, 
debugging, and validation. New methods and tools for this purpose are 
being developed within the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) 
subdomain of machine learning. In this work (1) we present the taxonomy 
of methods for model explanations, (2) we identify and compare 27 
packages available in R to perform XAI analysis, (3) we present an 
example of an application of particular packages, (4) we acknowledge 
recent trends in XAI. The article is primarily devoted to the tools 
available in R, but since it is easy to integrate the Python code, we 
will also show examples for the most popular libraries from Python.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Machine learning-based approaches are now able to examine 
functional magnetic resonance imaging data in a multivariate manner and 
extract features predictive of group membership. We applied support 
vector machine-based classification to resting state functional 
connectivity data from nicotine-dependent smokers and healthy controls 
to identify brain-based features predictive of nicotine dependence. By 
employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network 
functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for 
predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, 
or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its 
parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity 
measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are 
particularly informative in predicting smoking status. Our findings 
suggest that machine learning-based approaches to classifying resting 
state functional connectivity data offer a valuable alternative 
technique to understanding large-scale differences in addiction-related 
neurobiology.</td>

 applied support vector machine (SVM)-based classification to resting

smokers and healthy controls to identify brain-based features predictive
 of nicotine dependence. By employing a network-centered approach, we 
observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered 
maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to 
between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each 
individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our 
analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive 
control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in 
predicting smoking status.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FLMM52LII%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23964%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Machine%20learning-based%20approaches%20are%20now%20able%20to%20examine%20functional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging%20data%20in%20a%20multivariate%20manner%20and%20extract%20features%20predictive%20of%20group%20membership.%20We%20applied%20support%20vector%20machine-based%20classification%20to%20resting%20state%20functional%20connectivity%20data%20from%20nicotine-dependent%20smokers%20and%20healthy%20controls%20to%20identify%20brain-based%20features%20predictive%20of%20nicotine%20dependence.%20By%20employing%20a%20network-centered%20approach%2C%20we%20observed%20that%20within-network%20functional%20connectivity%20measures%20offered%20maximal%20information%20for%20predicting%20smoking%20status%2C%20as%20opposed%20to%20between-network%20connectivity%2C%20or%20the%20representativeness%20of%20each%20individual%20node%20with%20respect%20to%20its%20parent%20network.%20Further%2C%20our%20analysis%20suggests%20that%20connectivity%20measures%20within%20the%20executive%20control%20and%20frontoparietal%20networks%20are%20particularly%20informative%20in%20predicting%20smoking%20status.%20Our%20findings%20suggest%20that%20machine%20learning-based%20approaches%20to%20classifying%20resting%20state%20functional%20connectivity%20data%20offer%20a%20valuable%20alternative%20technique%20to%20understanding%20large-scale%20differences%20in%20addiction-related%20neurobiology.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Frontiers%20in%20Human%20Neuroscience%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.3389%2Ffnhum.2014.00425%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221662-5161%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Front.%20Hum.%20Neurosci.%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22English%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22publisher%3A%20Frontiers%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22Frontiers%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Machine%20learning%20classification%20of%20resting%20state%20functional%20connectivity%20predicts%20smoking%20status%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffnhum.2014.00425%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%228%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Pariyadath%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Vani%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Stein%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Elliot%20A.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Ross%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Thomas%20J.%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222024%22%2C5%2C14%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222014%22%2C6%2C16%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22pariyadathMachineLearningClassification2014a%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Pariyadath et al., 2014, p. 1</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical 
research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating 
disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an 
individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and 
complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic 
approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex 
data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed 
rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and 
analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics 
and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning,
 a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology 
that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make 
predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced 
exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision 
medicine’s multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets 
and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease. This
 review focuses on machine learning utilization for precision medicine’s
 “big data”, in the context of genetics, genomics, and beyond.</td>

 of many machine learning models are not easy to understand and 
interpret as noted above, especially with increased complexity of the 
input data and within the machine learning models themselves. This 
raises legal and ethical concerns, as research and physicians and other 
clinicians may not fully understand how a machine learning model came to
 a specific conclusion about a patient’s care. Current research in the 
machine learning domain is focussed on increasing the interpretability 
and thereby decreasing the “black box” nature of machine learning 
models, which will play a crucial role in the acceptance of such models 
within clinical decision making, as it will allow the physician or 
clinician to understand how the machine learning model came to a 
specific decision that then modifies care of the patient.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FRTADFP9S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22422%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23758%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Precision%20medicine%20is%20an%20emerging%20approach%20to%20clinical%20research%20and%20patient%20care%20that%20focuses%20on%20understanding%20and%20treating%20disease%20by%20integrating%20multi-modal%20or%20multi-omics%20data%20from%20an%20individual%20to%20make%20patient-tailored%20decisions.%20With%20the%20large%20and%20complex%20datasets%20generated%20using%20precision%20medicine%20diagnostic%20approaches%2C%20novel%20techniques%20to%20process%20and%20understand%20these%20complex%20data%20were%20needed.%20At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20computer%20science%20has%20progressed%20rapidly%20to%20develop%20techniques%20that%20enable%20the%20storage%2C%20processing%2C%20and%20analysis%20of%20these%20complex%20datasets%2C%20a%20feat%20that%20traditional%20statistics%20and%20early%20computing%20technologies%20could%20not%20accomplish.%20Machine%20learning%2C%20a%20branch%20of%20artificial%20intelligence%2C%20is%20a%20computer%20science%20methodology%20that%20aims%20to%20identify%20complex%20patterns%20in%20data%20that%20can%20be%20used%20to%20make%20predictions%20or%20classifications%20on%20new%20unseen%20data%20or%20for%20advanced%20exploratory%20data%20analysis.%20Machine%20learning%20analysis%20of%20precision%20medicine%E2%80%99s%20multi-modal%20data%20allows%20for%20broad%20analysis%20of%20large%20datasets%20and%20ultimately%20a%20greater%20understanding%20of%20human%20health%20and%20disease.%20This%20review%20focuses%20on%20machine%20learning%20utilization%20for%20precision%20medicine%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cbig%20data%E2%80%9D%2C%20in%20the%20context%20of%20genetics%2C%20genomics%2C%20and%20beyond.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Genome%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1139%2Fgen-2020-0131%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%220831-2796%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%224%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22publisher%3A%20NRC%20Research%20Press%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22416-425%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22cdnsciencepub.com%20(Atypon)%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Machine%20learning%20for%20precision%20medicine%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2264%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22MacEachern%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Sarah%20J.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Forkert%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Nils%20D.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222021%22%2C4%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 422</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Successfully treating illicit drug use has become 
paramount, yet elusive. Devising specialized treatment interventions 
could increase positive outcomes, but it is necessary to identify risk 
factors of poor long-term outcomes to develop specialized, efficacious 
treatments. We investigated whether functional network connectivity 
(FNC) measures were predictive of substance abuse treatment completion 
using machine learning pattern classification of functional magnetic 
resonance imaging data.
METHODS: Treatment-seeking stimulant- or heroin-dependent incarcerated 
participants (n&nbsp;= 139; 89 women) volunteered for a 12-week 
substance abuse treatment program. Participants performed a response 
inhibition Go/NoGo functional magnetic resonance imaging task prior to 
onset of the substance abuse treatment. We tested whether FNC related to
 the anterior cingulate cortex would be predictive of those who would or
 would not complete a 12-week substance abuse treatment program.
RESULTS: Machine learning pattern classification models using FNC 
between networks incorporating the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, 
and insula predicted which individuals would (sensitivity: 81.31%) or 
would not (specificity: 78.13%) complete substance abuse treatment. FNC 
analyses predicted treatment completion above and beyond other clinical 
assessment measures, including age, sex, IQ, years of substance use, 
psychopathy, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and motivation for 
change.
CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant neural network connections predicted substance 
abuse treatment outcomes, which could illuminate new targets for 
developing interventions designed to reduce or eliminate substance use 
while facilitating long-term outcomes. This work represents the first 
application of machine-learning models of FNC analyses of functional 
magnetic resonance imaging data to predict which substance abusers would
 or would not complete treatment.</td>

			<h2>Matching alcoholism treatments to client heterogeneity: treatment

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>OBJECTIVE: This article examines client drinking and related 
psychosocial functioning during the course of alcoholism treatment. It 
focuses on (1) the main effects of the three Project MATCH treatments, 
(2) the prognostic value of client attributes employed in the matching 
hypotheses, and (3) the attribute by treatment interaction effects.
METHOD: Clients recruited from outpatient settings (n = 952) or from 
aftercare settings (n = 774) were randomized to one of the following 
treatments: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral
 Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Alcohol consumption 
and psychosocial functioning during treatment were assessed at the end 
of the 12-week treatment phase.
RESULTS: During the treatment phase, small but statistically significant
 differences among treatments were found only in the outpatient arm on 
measures of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related negative 
consequences. Forty-one percent (41%) of CBT and TSF clients were 
abstinent or drank moderately without alcohol-related consequences, 
compared with 28% of MET clients. Tests of 10 a priori primary 
client-treatment matching hypotheses failed to find any interaction 
effects that had an impact on drinking throughout the treatment phase.
CONCLUSIONS: In the outpatient setting there appears to be a temporary 
advantage to assigning individuals to CBT or TSF rather than MET. When 
there is a need to quickly reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related 
consequences, it appears that CBT or TSF should be the treatment of 
choice.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Transdermal nicotine is widely used for smoking cessation, but
 only ~20% of smokers quit successfully with this medication. 
Interindividual variability in nicotine metabolism rate may influence 
treatment response. This study sought to validate, and extend in a 
larger sample, our previous finding that the ratio of plasma nicotine 
metabolites 3′-hydroxycotinine (3-HC)/cotinine, a measure of nicotine 
metabolism rate, predicts response to nicotine patch. A sample of 568 
smokers was enrolled in a study that provided counseling and 8-weeks of 
21&nbsp;mg nicotine patch. Pretreatment 3-HC/cotinine ratio was examined
 as a predictor of 7-day point prevalence abstinence, verified with 
breath carbon monoxide (CO), 8&nbsp;weeks after the quit date. 
Controlling for sex, race, age, and nicotine dependence, smokers in the 
upper 3 quartiles of 3-HC/cotinine ratio (faster metabolizers) were ~50%
 less likely to be abstinent vs. smokers in the first quartile (slow 
metabolizers; 28% vs. 42%; OR=.54 [95% CI:.36–.82], p=.003). Among 
abstainers, plasma nicotine levels (assessed 1&nbsp;week after treatment
 began) decreased linearly across the 3-HC/cotinine ratio (β=−3.38, 
t[355]=−3.09, p&lt;.05). These data support the value of the 
3-HC/cotinine ratio as a biomarker to predict success with transdermal 
nicotine for smoking cessation.</td>

 sample of 568 smokers was enrolled in a study that provided counseling 
and 8-weeks of 21mg nicotine patch. Pretreatment 3-HC/cotinine ratio was
 examined as a predictor of 7-day point prevalence abstinence, verified 
with breath carbon monoxide (CO), 8 weeks after the quit date. 
Controlling for sex, race, age, and nicotine dependence, smokers in the 
upper 3 quartiles of 3-HC/cotinine ratio (faster metabolizers) were ~50%
 less likely to be abstinent vs. smokers in the first quartile (slow 
metabolizers; 28% vs. 42%; OR=. 54 [95% CI: .36–.82], p=.003).”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F4AEQ2DGY%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23790%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Transdermal%20nicotine%20is%20widely%20used%20for%20smoking%20cessation%2C%20but%20only%20~20%25%20of%20smokers%20quit%20successfully%20with%20this%20medication.%20Interindividual%20variability%20in%20nicotine%20metabolism%20rate%20may%20influence%20treatment%20response.%20This%20study%20sought%20to%20validate%2C%20and%20extend%20in%20a%20larger%20sample%2C%20our%20previous%20finding%20that%20the%20ratio%20of%20plasma%20nicotine%20metabolites%203%E2%80%B2-hydroxycotinine%20(3-HC)%2Fcotinine%2C%20a%20measure%20of%20nicotine%20metabolism%20rate%2C%20predicts%20response%20to%20nicotine%20patch.%20A%20sample%20of%20568%20smokers%20was%20enrolled%20in%20a%20study%20that%20provided%20counseling%20and%208-weeks%20of%2021%C2%A0mg%20nicotine%20patch.%20Pretreatment%203-HC%2Fcotinine%20ratio%20was%20examined%20as%20a%20predictor%20of%207-day%20point%20prevalence%20abstinence%2C%20verified%20with%20breath%20carbon%20monoxide%20(CO)%2C%208%C2%A0weeks%20after%20the%20quit%20date.%20Controlling%20for%20sex%2C%20race%2C%20age%2C%20and%20nicotine%20dependence%2C%20smokers%20in%20the%20upper%203%20quartiles%20of%203-HC%2Fcotinine%20ratio%20(faster%20metabolizers)%20were%20~50%25%20less%20likely%20to%20be%20abstinent%20vs.%20smokers%20in%20the%20first%20quartile%20(slow%20metabolizers%3B%2028%25%20vs.%2042%25%3B%20OR%3D.54%20%5B95%25%20CI%3A.36%E2%80%93.82%5D%2C%20p%3D.003).%20Among%20abstainers%2C%20plasma%20nicotine%20levels%20(assessed%201%C2%A0week%20after%20treatment%20began)%20decreased%20linearly%20across%20the%203-HC%2Fcotinine%20ratio%20(%CE%B2%3D%E2%88%923.38%2C%20t%5B355%5D%3D%E2%88%923.09%2C%20p%3C.05).%20These%20data%20support%20the%20value%20of%20the%203-HC%2Fcotinine%20ratio%20as%20a%20biomarker%20to%20predict%20success%20with%20transdermal%20nicotine%20for%20smoking%20cessation.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Pharmacology%20Biochemistry%20and%20Behavior%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1016%2Fj.pbb.2008.10.016%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%220091-3057%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%221%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Pharmacology%20Biochemistry%20and%20Behavior%22%2C%22page%22%3A%226-11%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22ScienceDirect%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Nicotine%20metabolic%20rate%20predicts%20successful%20smoking%20cessation%20with%20transdermal%20nicotine%3A%20A%20validation%20study%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Nicotine%20metabolic%20rate%20predicts%20successful%20smoking%20cessation%20with%20transdermal%20nicotine%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2292%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Schnoll%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Robert%20A.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Patterson%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Freda%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Wileyto%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22E.%20Paul%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Tyndale%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Rachel%20F.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Benowitz%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Neal%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Lerman%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Caryn%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222009%22%2C3%2C1%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22schnollNicotineMetabolicRate2009%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Schnoll et al., 2009, p. 1</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FAWG85A82%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22EALJ4J9Z%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23a28ae5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B108%2C299.048%2C483.21%2C310.108%5D%2C%5B108%2C287.048%2C282.7%2C298.108%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F4AEQ2DGY%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D">“These

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly 
heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, 
underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, it is possible that only 
certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to antidepressants. A 
potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus 
on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, 
anhedonia, and cognitive control deficits.
METHODS: Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for 
depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of 
machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate 
individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype 
profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Five pre-treatment variables moderated treatment response. 
Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment 
in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with 
better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations of a 
10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31% of the sample
 would exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with 
sertraline relative to placebo. Although there were no overall outcome 
differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as 
optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD 
scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 
0.58).
CONCLUSIONS: A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can
 be identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model
 must be tested prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment 
selection. However, findings demonstrate the potential to improve 
individual outcomes through algorithm-guided treatment recommendations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Theoretically, substance use disorder (SUD) 
treatment that matches an individual's etiology and/or maintaining 
factors should be more effective than a treatment that does not directly
 address these factors. Impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking may 
contribute to the development and maintenance of SUDs, and are potential
 candidate variables for assigning patients to treatment. The goal is to
 identify whether current research can provide insight into which 
treatments may be most effective for individuals high in impulsivity or 
sensation seeking, relative to other treatments. A secondary goal is to 
provide recommendations for personalizing SUD treatment based on 
etiology or maintaining factors.
METHOD: This review summarizes clinical trials that speak to the 
differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for alcohol, 
tobacco, and other drug use disorders, based on pre-treatment 
impulsivity, sensation seeking, or related constructs.
RESULTS: Few studies examine the differential effectiveness of two or 
more treatments for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation 
seeking. Very preliminary evidence suggests that contingency management 
may hold promise for individuals high in impulsivity. Pharmacological 
trials were under-represented in the current review, despite evidence 
that the effectiveness of some pharmacological interventions may be 
moderated by impulsivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential reasons for slow rate of progress to date are 
provided. Given slow accumulation of evidence, an alternative method for
 personalizing treatment based on pre-treatment psychosocial factors, 
including impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking, is proposed. Future 
research may explore the role of contingency management for SUD among 
individuals with high pre-treatment impulsivity or sensation seeking. 
Finally, novel, technology-enhanced behavioral mechanisms are discussed 
as an adjunct to SUD treatment for these high-risk populations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Clinical trials have identified numerous prescriptive 
predictors of mental disorder treatment response, ie, predictors of 
which treatments are best for which patients. However, none of these 
prescriptive predictors is strong enough alone to guide precision 
treatment planning. This has prompted growing interest in developing 
precision treatment rules (PTRs) that combine information across 
multiple prescriptive predictors, but this work has been much less 
successful in psychiatry than some other areas of medicine. Study 
designs and analysis schemes used in research on PTR development in 
other areas of medicine are reviewed, key challenges for implementing 
similar studies of mental disorders are highlighted, and recent 
methodological advances to address these challenges are described 
here.Discovering prescriptive predictors requires large samples. Three 
approaches have been used in other areas of medicine to do this: conduct
 very large randomized clinical trials, pool individual-level results 
across multiple smaller randomized clinical trials, and develop 
preliminary PTRs in large observational treatment samples that are then 
tested in smaller randomized clinical trials. The third approach is most
 feasible for research on mental disorders. This approach requires 
working with large real-world observational electronic health record 
databases; carefully selecting samples to emulate trials; extracting 
information about prescriptive predictors from electronic health records
 along with other inexpensive data augmentation strategies; estimating 
preliminary PTRs in the observational data using appropriate methods; 
implementing pragmatic trials to validate the preliminary PTRs; and 
iterating between subsequent observational studies and quality 
improvement pragmatic trials to refine and expand the PTRs. New 
statistical methods exist to address the methodological challenges of 
implementing this approach.Advances in pragmatic precision psychiatry 
will require moving beyond the current focus on randomized clinical 
trials and adopting an iterative discovery-confirmation process that 
integrates observational and experimental studies in real-world clinical
 populations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background and aims Precision, personalized or stratified 
medicine, which promises to deliver the right treatment to the right 
patient, is a topic of international interest in both the lay press and 
the scientific literature. A key aspect of precision medicine is the 
identification of biomarkers that predict the response to medications 
(i.e. pharmacogenetics). We examined why, despite the great strides that
 have been made in biomarker identification in many areas of medicine, 
only in oncology has there been substantial progress in their clinical 
implementation. We also considered why progress in this effort has 
lagged in addiction medicine. Methods We compared the development of 
pharmacogenetic biomarkers in oncology, cardiovascular medicine (where 
developments are also promising) and addictive disorders. Results The 
first major reason for the success of oncologic pharmacogenetics is 
ready access to tumor tissue, which allows in-vitro testing and insights
 into cancer biology. The second major reason is funding, with cancer 
research receiving, by far, the largest allocation by the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) during the past two decades. The second 
largest allocation of research funding has gone to cardiovascular 
disease research. Addictions research received a much smaller NIH 
funding allocation, despite the major impact that tobacco use, alcohol 
consumption and illicit drug use have on the public health and 
healthcare costs. Conclusions Greater support for research on the 
personalized treatment of addictive disorders can be expected to yield 
disproportionately large benefits to the public health and substantial 
reductions in healthcare costs.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Objective
To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction 
applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe 
which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and 
whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with 
established reporting guidelines.

Design
A scoping review.

Data sources
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane 
Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018.

Eligibility criteria
We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used 
machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We 
excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted 
to a clinical context.

Data extraction and synthesis
We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included 
general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting 
of results and model discussion items.

Results
Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review.
 The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most 
studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied 
outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and 
the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 
54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most 
common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended 
guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive 
discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver 
operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22,
 9.52%).

Conclusions
Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on 
regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, 
infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were
 under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for 
predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in 
population health.

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Introduction and Aims. People attending substance abuse 
treatment have an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and cancer. Consequently, there have been increasing calls for 
substance abuse treatment services to address smoking. The current study
 examined smoking behaviours of people attending residential substance 
abuse treatment. Additionally, the study examined rates of other 
potentially modifiable health risk factors for the development of CVD 
and cancer. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional survey was completed 
by participants attending Australian Salvation Army residential 
substance abuse treatment services (n = 228). Rates of smoking, 
exercise, dietary fat intake, body mass index and depression were 
identified and compared with representative community populations. The 
relationship between length of treatment and changes in these variables 
was also examined. Results. When compared with the Australian 
population, participants were much more likely to be current smokers. 
They also showed higher rates of dietary fat intake, and having had a 
previous diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Encouragingly, participants
 were more likely to be engaging in regular exercise. Over a third of 
all smokers reported having increased their smoking since attending the 
residential program, with correlational analysis suggesting that 
nicotine dependence was increasing the longer participants were in 
treatment. Discussion and Conclusions. People attending substance abuse 
treatment show extremely high rates of smoking (77%). With the large 
majority of participants showing multiple risk factors for CVD, it is 
important that residential services consider strategies to address 
smoking and the other potentially modifiable health risk factors in an 
integrated fashion.[Kelly PJ, Baker AL, Deane FP, Kay-Lambkin FJ,

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>No single treatment approach is effective for all persons with
 alcohol problems. A more promising strategy involves assigning patients
 to alternative treatments based on specific needs and characteristics 
of patients. Project MATCH is a multisite clinical trial designed to 
test a series of a priori hypotheses on how patient-treatment 
interactions relate to outcome. Two independent but parallel matching 
studies are being conducted, one with clients recruited from outpatient 
settings, the other with patients receiving aftercare treatment 
following inpatient care. Patients are randomly assigned to Twelve-Step 
Facilitation, Cognitive-Behavioral Coping Skills, or Motivational 
Enhancement Therapy. Subjects are followed at 3-month intervals for 1 
year following completion of the 12-week treatment period and evaluated 
for changes in drinking patterns, functional status/quality of life, and
 treatment services utilization. Interaction effects with selected 
patient characteristics will be studied. Project MATCH will provide a 
rigorous test of the utility of patient-treatment matching in general 
and, depending on the specific a priori hypotheses validated, will have 
important implications for clinical practice.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background
In samples from controlled randomized clinical trials, a smoker’s rate 
of nicotine metabolism, measured by the 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine 
ratio (NMR), predicts response to transdermal nicotine. Replication of 
this relationship in community-based samples of treatment-seeking 
smokers may help guide the implementation of the NMR for personalized 
treatment for nicotine dependence.
Methods
Data from a community-based sample of treatment seeking smokers (N=499) 
who received 8weeks of transdermal nicotine and 4 behavioral counseling 
sessions were used to evaluate associations between the NMR and smoking 
cessation. Secondary outcomes included withdrawal and craving, 
depression and anxiety, side effects, and treatment adherence.
Results
The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR=.56, 95% CI: 
0.33-0.95, p=.03), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates 
than slower metabolizers (24% vs. 33%). Faster nicotine metabolizers 
exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms over time 
during treatment, vs. slower metabolizers (NMR x Time interaction: 
F[3,357]=3.29, p=.02). NMR was not associated with changes in 
withdrawal, craving, depression, side effects, and treatment adherence 
(p’s&gt;.05).
Conclusions
In a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers, faster 
nicotine metabolizers were significantly less likely to quit smoking and
 showed higher rates of anxiety symptoms during a smoking cessation 
treatment program, vs. slower nicotine metabolizers. These results 
provide further evidence that transdermal nicotine is less effective for
 faster nicotine metabolizers and suggest the need to address 
cessation-induced anxiety symptoms among these smokers to increase the 
chances for successful smoking cessation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background
Patients under antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia commonly 
exhibit poor adherence to treatment, high rates of treatment 
discontinuation, and frequent treatment changes. The ETOS study aimed to
 identify the reasons leading physicians to decide to switch 
antipsychotic treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia and to 
evaluate the outcome of this switch.

Methods
ETOS was an observational 18-week (four visits) study in outpatients 18 
to 65&nbsp;years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition 
criteria at least 6&nbsp;months prior to enrolment, who were initiated 
on a new antipsychotic monotherapy treatment within the 2&nbsp;weeks 
prior to enrollment. A total of 574 patients were recruited by 87 
hospital- and office-based physicians. Ethical approval was obtained 
prior to study initiation (NCT00999895).

Results
The final analysis included 568 patients, 39.0 ± 11.2&nbsp;years old 
with mean disease duration of 11.7&nbsp;years. The male-to-female ratio 
was 53:47. The main reason for switching antipsychotic treatment was 
lack of tolerability (n = 369, 65.0%), followed by lack of efficacy 
(n = 249, 43.8%). Following treatment switch, 87.9% of patients 
(n = 499) showed meaningful clinical benefit by achieving a Clinical 
Global Impression-Clinical Benefit score of ≤4 at the final visit. By 
the end of the study, total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 
Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, Clinical Global 
Impression-Severity, and Simpson-Angus Scale scores demonstrated 
significant mean decreases of 31.69, 0.70, 1.14, and 11.30, respectively
 (all p &lt; 0.0001). Treatment adherence remarkably improved.

Conclusion
In the ETOS study, switch of antipsychotic monotherapy for reasons 
relating to lack of efficacy and/or tolerability was associated with 
significantly improved clinical benefit and significant increase of 
patients' adherence to treatment.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The aim was to evaluate if recycling of failures from a 
smoking cessation study may be of value. The study comprised 126 smokers
 (50%) of 252 failures, from a double-blind smoking cessation trial with
 nicotine patch, who accepted recycling after 1 year. Subjects were 
allocated nicotine patches delivering 15, 20 or 25 mg of nicotine (over 
16 hours) according to their base-line saliva cotinine concentrations in
 an open trial. The treatment period was 12 weeks followed by tapering 
over 6 weeks. The percentage of quitters after 3, 12, 26, and 52 weeks 
was 44, 20, 7 and 6%, respectively. After 26 weeks, all subjects had 
relapsed in the group previously treated with active nicotine patch 
compared with 12% abstainers in the previous placebo subjects. The 
sustained abstinence rate without slips after one year was 2%. Recycling
 does not seem to be of long-term clinical relevance in our set-up for 
subjects initially treated with nicotine, but of some value in subjects 
quitting without nicotine therapy initially.</td>

						<td>This article explains a decision rule that uses Bayesian 
posterior distributions as the basis for accepting or rejecting null 
values of parameters. This decision rule focuses on the range of 
plausible values indicated by the highest density interval of the 
posterior distribution and the relation between this range and a region 
of practical equivalence (ROPE) around the null value. The article also 
discusses considerations for setting the limits of a ROPE and emphasizes
 that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds 
for p values and Bayes factors.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for 
an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult
 onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific 
DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic 
architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of 
complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the 
genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the 
genetic studies of the last 5 years.
METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods investigating the polygenic 
nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile 
(or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or 
heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also 
provided. We review results of applications of the methods to 
psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods 
inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing 
heritability.
FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing 
evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they 
have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk 
variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes 
published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the 
magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained
 by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association 
studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more
 associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These 
loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might 
eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved 
biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will 
contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as 
sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in 
phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of 
nongenetic risk factors.</td>

			<h2>Searching for Personalized Medicine for Binge Drinking Smokers: 
Smoking Cessation Using Varenicline, Nicotine Patch, or Combination

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Objective:

Heavy drinking is common among smokers and is associated with especially
 poor health outcomes. Varenicline may affect mechanisms and clinical 
outcomes that are relevant for both smoking cessation and alcohol use. 
The current study examines whether varenicline, relative to nicotine 
replacement therapy, yields better smoking cessation outcomes among 
binge drinking smokers.

Method:

Secondary data analyses of a comparative effectiveness randomized 
controlled trial of three smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (12 weeks 
of varenicline, nicotine patch, or nicotine patch and lozenge) paired 
with six counseling sessions were conducted. Adult daily cigarette 
smokers (N = 1,078, 52% female) reported patterns of alcohol use, 
cigarette craving, and alcohol-related cigarette craving at baseline and
 over 4 weeks after quitting. Smoking cessation outcome was 7-day 
biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence.

Results:

Binge drinkers had higher relapse rates than moderate drinkers at 4-week
 post-target quit day but not at the end of treatment or long-term 
follow up (12 and 26 weeks). Varenicline did not yield superior smoking 
cessation outcomes among binge drinkers, nor did it affect alcohol use 
early in the quit attempt. Varenicline did produce relatively large 
reductions in alcohol-related cigarette craving and overall cigarette 
craving during the first 4 weeks after quitting.

Conclusions:

Varenicline did not yield higher smoking abstinence rates or reduce 
alcohol use among binge drinkers. Varenicline did reduce alcohol-related
 cigarette craving but this did not translate to meaningful differences 
in smoking abstinence. Varenicline’s effects on smoking abstinence do 
not appear to vary significantly as a function of drinking status.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BackgroundTo date, there has been no review of the research 
evidence examining smoking cessation among homeless adults. The current 
review aimed to: (i) estimate smoking prevalence in homeless 
populations; (ii) explore the efficacy of smoking cessation and smoking 
reduction interventions for homeless individuals; and (iii) describe the
 barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation and smoking 
reduction.MethodSystematic review of peer-reviewed research. Data 
sources included electronic academic databases. Search terms: ‘smoking’ 
AND ‘homeless’ AND ‘tobacco’, including adult (18+ years) smokers 
accessing homeless support services.ResultsFifty-three studies met the 
inclusion criteria (n = 46 USA). Data could not be meta-analysed due to 
large methodological inconsistencies and the lack of randomised 
controlled trials. Smoking prevalence ranged from 57% to 82%. Although 
there was no clear evidence on which cessation methods work best, 
layered approaches with additions to usual care seemed to offer modest 
enhancements in quit rates. Key barriers to cessation exist around the 
priority of smoking, beliefs around negative impact on mental health and
 substance use, and environmental influences.ConclusionsHomeless smokers
 will benefit from layered interventions which support many of their 
competing needs. To best understand what works, future recommendations 
include the need for consensus on the reporting of cessation outcomes.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The current study examined socio-demographic variability in 
adolescent substance use and the mediating roles of maternal knowledge, 
paternal knowledge and peer substance use. The data were obtained from 
the United States records (N = 8,795) of the Health Behavior in 
School-Aged Children 2005/2006 Survey, in grades 6 through 10. The 
analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural 
equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of
 alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past 
month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance 
use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on 
adolescent substance use through its negative association with 
substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect 
influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated 
differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between 
Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences 
between adolescents from two-parent families and those from 
single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families. Parental 
knowledge and peer substance were important mediators which largely 
accounted for variability in the prevalence of adolescent substance use 
by grade, race/ethnicity, and family structure.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have yielded significant 
advances in the understanding of neural processes relevant to the 
development and persistence of addiction. However, these advances have 
not explored extensively for diagnostic accuracy in human subjects. The 
aim of this study was to develop a statistical approach, using a machine
 learning framework, to correctly classify brain images of 
cocaine-dependent participants and healthy controls. In this study, a 
framework suitable for educing potential brain regions that differed 
between the two groups was developed and implemented. Single Photon 
Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) images obtained during rest or a
 saline infusion in three cohorts of 2-4 week abstinent 
cocaine-dependent participants (n = 93) and healthy controls (n = 69) 
were used to develop a classification model. An information 
theoretic-based feature selection algorithm was first conducted to 
reduce the number of voxels. A density-based clustering algorithm was 
then used to form spatially connected voxel clouds in three-dimensional 
space. A statistical classifier, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), was then
 used for participant classification. Statistically insignificant voxels
 of spatially connected brain regions were removed iteratively and 
classification accuracy was reported through the iterations.
RESULTS: The voxel-based analysis identified 1,500 spatially connected 
voxels in 30 distinct clusters after a grid search in SVM parameters. 
Participants were successfully classified with 0.88 and 
0.89&nbsp;F-measure accuracies in 10-fold cross validation (10xCV) and 
leave-one-out (LOO) approaches, respectively. Sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.90 and 0.89 for LOO; 0.83 and 0.83 for 10xCV. Many of
 the 30 selected clusters are highly relevant to the addictive process, 
including regions relevant to cognitive control, default mode network 
related self-referential thought, behavioral inhibition, and contextual 
memories. Relative hyperactivity and hypoactivity of regional cerebral 
blood flow in brain regions in cocaine-dependent participants are 
presented with corresponding level of significance.
CONCLUSIONS: The SVM-based approach successfully classified 
cocaine-dependent and healthy control participants using voxels selected
 with information theoretic-based and statistical methods from 
participants' SPECT data. The regions found in this study align with 
brain regions reported in the literature. These findings support the 
future use of brain imaging and SVM-based classifier in the diagnosis of
 substance use disorders and furthering an understanding of their 
underlying pathology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Most smokers have a history of unsuccessful quit attempts. 
This study used data from 7 waves (2002–2009) of the International 
Tobacco Control 4-country cohort study to examine the role of smokers’ 
quitting history (e.g., recency, length, and number of previous quit 
attempts) on their subsequent likelihood of making a quit attempt and 
achieving at least 6 months of sustained abstinence.Generalized 
estimating equations were used, allowing for estimation of relationships
 between variables across repeated observations while controlling for 
correlations from multiple responses by the same individual (29,682 
observations from 13,417 individuals).The likelihood of a future quit 
attempt increased independently with recency and number of prior 
attempts. By contrast, the likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence 
of at least 6 months was reduced for smokers with a failed quit attempt 
within the last year (15.1% vs. 27.1% for those without, p &amp;lt; 
.001). Two or more failed attempts (vs. only one) in the previous year 
were also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving sustained 
abstinence (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.85). Effects persisted after 
controlling for levels of addiction, self-efficacy to quit, and use of 
stop-smoking medications.There appears to be a subset of smokers who 
repeatedly attempt but fail to remain abstinent from tobacco. 
Understanding why repeated attempts might be less successful in the long
 term is an important research priority because it implies a need to 
tailor treatment approaches for those who are motivated to quit but 
persistently relapse back to smoking.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a genetically informed 
biomarker of rate of nicotine metabolism, has been validated as a tool 
to select the optimal treatment for individual smokers, thereby 
improving treatment outcomes. This review summarizes the evidence 
supporting the development of the NMR as a biomarker of individual 
differences in nicotine metabolism, the relationship between the NMR and
 smoking behavior, the clinical utility of using the NMR to personalize 
treatments for smoking cessation, and the potential mechanisms that 
underlie the relationship between NMR and smoking cessation. We conclude
 with a call for additional research necessary to determine the ultimate
 benefits of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking 
cessation. These future directions include measurement and other 
methodologic considerations, disseminating this approach to at-risk 
subpopulations, expanding the NMR to evaluate its efficacy in predicting
 treatment responses to e-cigarettes and other noncigarette forms of 
nicotine, and implementation science including cost-effectiveness 
analyses.See all articles in this Special Collection Honoring Paul F.

 second important future direction will be to generalize the 
personalized approach to population subgroups with elevated smoking 
rates and altered NMR. For example, the mean NMR may be substantially 
higher among certain Native American/ Indian tribes (71), among pregnant
 women (56, 100), among individuals who are HIVþ (53), and among those 
who consume heavy amounts of alcohol (55). Furthermore, while rates of 
smoking among people with serious mental illness (101), substance use 
conditions (57), and among those from the LGBTQ community (102) are 2–3

						<td>Bayesian analysis used here to answer the question: "when 
looking at resampling results, are the differences between models 
'real'?" To answer this, a model can be created were the performance 
statistic is the resampling statistics (e.g. accuracy or RMSE). These 
values are explained by the model types. In doing this, we can get 
parameter estimates for each model's affect on performance and make 
statistical (and practical) comparisons between models. The methods 
included here are similar to Benavoli et al (2017)

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: The development of tobacco use treatments that are
 effective for all smokers is critical to improving clinical and public 
health. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses highly 
efficient factorial experiments to evaluate multiple intervention 
components for possible inclusion in an optimized tobacco use treatment.
 Factorial experiments permit analyses of the influence of patient 
characteristics on main and interaction effects of multiple, relatively 
discrete, intervention components. This study examined whether 
person-factor and smoking characteristics moderated the main or 
interactive effects of intervention components on 26-week self-reported 
abstinence rates.
METHODS: This fractional factorial experiment evaluated six smoking 
cessation intervention components among primary care patients (N=637): 
Prequit Nicotine Patch vs. None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs. None, 
Preparation Counseling vs. None, Intensive Cessation In-Person 
Counseling vs. Minimal, Intensive Cessation Telephone Counseling vs. 
Minimal, and 16 vs. 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy 
(NRT; nicotine patch+nicotine gum).
RESULTS: Both psychiatric history and smoking heaviness moderated 
intervention component effects. In comparison with participants with no 
self-reported history of a psychiatric disorder, those with a positive 
history showed better response to 16- vs. 8-weeks of combination NRT, 
but a poorer response to counseling interventions. Also, in contrast to 
light smokers, heavier smokers showed a poorer response to counseling 
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Heavy smokers and those with psychiatric histories 
demonstrated a differential response to intervention components. This 
research illustrates the use of factorial designs to examine the 
interactions between person characteristics and relatively discrete 
intervention components. Future research is needed to replicate these 
findings.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Understanding how smoking cessation treatments 
exert their effects can inform treatment development and use. Factorial 
designs allow researchers to examine whether multiple intervention 
components affect hypothesized change mechanisms, and whether the 
affected mechanisms are related to cessation.
METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of smokers recruited during 
primary care visits (N=637, 55% women, 87% white) who were motivated to 
quit. Participants in this fractional factorial experiment were 
randomized to one level of each of six intervention factors: Prequit 
Nicotine Patch vs None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs None, Preparation 
Counseling vs None, Intensive In-Person Counseling vs Minimal, Intensive
 Phone Counseling vs Minimal, and 16 vs 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine 
Replacement (nicotine patch+nicotine gum). Data on putative mechanisms 
(e.g., medication use, withdrawal, self-efficacy) and smoking status 
were gathered using daily assessments and during follow-up assessment 
calls.
RESULTS: Some intervention components influenced hypothesized 
mechanisms. Prequit Gum and Patch each reduced prequit smoking and 
enhanced prequit coping and self-efficacy. In-Person Counseling 
increased prequit motivation to quit, postquit self-efficacy, and 
postquit perceived intratreatment support. Withdrawal reduction and 
reduced prequit smoking produced the strongest effects on cessation. The
 significant effect of combining Prequit Gum and In-Person Counseling on
 26-week abstinence was mediated by increased prequit self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: This factorial experiment identified which putative 
treatment mechanisms were influenced by discrete intervention components
 and which mechanisms influenced cessation. Such information supports 
the combined use of prequit nicotine gum and intensive in-person 
counseling as cessation interventions that operate via increased prequit
 self-efficacy.</td>

 sum, the tested Preparation and Cessation phase intervention components
 decreased prequit smoking rates (Prequit Patch and Gum), increased 
postquit use of nicotine gum (Prequit Gum), increased active postquit 
coping (Prequit Gum especially when combined with In-Person Counseling),
 increased intra-treatment social support (Preparation and In-Person 
Counseling), and increased prequit motivation to quit (In-Person 
Counseling especially when combined with Preparation Counseling). 
However, in many cases, putative mechanisms did not link treatment to 
long-term outcomes in a significant manner (i.e., they did not produce 
significant mediation). Nevertheless, these findings might guide the 
development and selection of intervention components allowing for the 
selection of interventions that yield complementary effects on 
mechanisms. In addition, these findings may enhance our understanding of
 reasons that smoking treatments do or do not work. This research also 
underscores the importance of conducting factorial experiments, which

relatively discrete interventions.</span></span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance 
use disorders (SUDs) may have common etiologies. ADHD is more prevalent 
in patients with substance use disorders, and this pattern is consistent
 across different substances of abuse. Individuals with SUDs and ADHD 
exhibit significant variations in their clinical presentations. The 
developmental trajectory of ADHD to SUDs is complex: ADHD symptoms 
appear first in some patients but not in others. Many patients present 
with a heterogeneous collection of psychiatric and substance use 
co-morbidities, and these symptoms change over time. ADHD symptom 
severity is also highly variable, and more severe ADHD symptoms worsen 
co-morbid SUDs and complicate treatment. New longitudinal studies with 
innovative methods in high-risk populations and in community-based 
samples may clarify issues related to patient-treatment matching. When 
closely monitored, psychostimulant and other adjunct medications can be 
safely used to treat ADHD in this population, and such treatment may 
also improve outcome of SUDs. In particular, emerging evidence suggests 
individual-level tailoring ("precision medicine") approaches may 
represent a key pathway to improve clinical outcome.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each
 year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million 
people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If 
they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related 
morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of 
life.Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical 
nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people 
who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who 
attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts
 before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and 
pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products,
 varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used 
individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a 
meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the 
combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a
 quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with
 brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind
 clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the 
efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and 
placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for 
varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch 
(15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a
 nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a 
single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action,
 such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies 
compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral 
support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text 
messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician’s brief advice
 to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is 
effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all 
health care settings.Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke 
cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy 
by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both 
pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination 
NRT as preferred initial interventions.</td>

 This article reviews several advantages of Bayesian data analysis over 
traditional null-hypothesis significance testing. Bayesian methods 
provide tremendous flexibility for data analytic models and yield rich 
information about parameters that can be used cumulatively across 
progressive experiments. Because Bayesian statistical methods can be 
applied to any data, regardless of the type of cognitive model (Bayesian
 or otherwise) that motivated the data collection, Bayesian methods for 
data analysis will continue to be appropriate even if Bayesian models of
