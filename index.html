<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of a machine learning framework to predict substance use disorder treatment success;,citation_abstract=There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.;,citation_author=Laura Acion;,citation_author=Diana Kelmansky;,citation_author=Mark Laan;,citation_author=Ethan Sahker;,citation_author=DeShauna Jones;,citation_author=Stephan Arndt;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0175383;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=28394905;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS One;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Utility of Machine-Learning Approaches to Identify Behavioral Markers for Substance Use Disorders: Impulsivity Dimensions as Predictors of Current Cocaine Dependence;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Identifying objective and accurate markers of cocaine dependence (CD) can innovate its prevention and treatment. Existing evidence suggests that CD is characterized by a wide range of cognitive deficits, most notably by increased impulsivity. Impulsivity is multidimensional and it is unclear which of its various dimensions would have the highest predictive utility for CD. The machine-learning approach is highly promising for discovering predictive markers of disease. Here, we used machine learning to identify multivariate predictive patterns of impulsivity phenotypes that can accurately classify individuals with CD. METHODS: Current cocaine-dependent users (N = 31) and healthy controls (N = 23) completed the self-report Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 and five neurocognitive tasks indexing different dimensions of impulsivity: (1) Immediate Memory Task (IMT), (2) Stop-Signal Task, (3) Delay-Discounting Task (DDT), (4) Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and (5) Probabilistic Reversal-Learning task. We applied a machine-learning algorithm to all impulsivity measures. RESULTS: Machine learning accurately classified individuals with CD and predictions were generalizable to new samples (area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.912 in the test set). CD membership was predicted by higher scores on motor and non-planning trait impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and discriminability on the IMT, higher delay discounting on the DDT, and poor decision making on the IGT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that multivariate behavioral impulsivity phenotypes can predict CD with high degree of accuracy, which can potentially be used to assess individuals’ vulnerability to CD in clinical settings.;,citation_author=Woo-Young Ahn;,citation_author=Divya Ramesh;,citation_author=Frederick Gerard Moeller;,citation_author=Jasmin Vassileva;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00034;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_pmid=27014100;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Nicotine Patch vs Varenicline vs Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy on Smoking Cessation at 26 Weeks: A Randomized Clinical Trial;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week quit rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three-group randomized intention-to-treat clinical trial occurring from May 2012 to November 2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, communities; 65.5% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) refused participation prior to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch only (n = 241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; n = 424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge; n = 421). Six counseling sessions were offered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52. RESULTS: Among 1086 smokers randomized (52% women; 67% white; mean age, 48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84%) provided 12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8% [55/241]; varenicline, 23.6% [100/424]; and C-NRT, 26.8% [113/421]) or at 52 weeks (nicotine patch, 20.8% [50/241]; varenicline, 19.1% [81/424]; and C-NRT, 20.2% [85/421]). At 26 weeks, the risk differences for abstinence were, for patch vs varenicline, -0.76% (95% CI, -7.4% to 5.9%); for patch vs C-NRT, -4.0% (95% CI, -10.8% to 2.8%); and for varenicline vs C-NRT, -3.3% (95% CI, -9.1% to 2.6%). All medications were well tolerated, but varenicline produced more frequent adverse events than did the nicotine patch for vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and indigestion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or C-NRT produced no significant differences in biochemically confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise questions about the relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01553084.;,citation_author=Timothy B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Smoking Treatment: A Report Card on Progress and Challenges;,citation_abstract=The impact of tobacco smoking treatment is determined by its reach into the smoking population and the effectiveness of its interventions. This review evaluates the reach and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for smoking. Historically, the reach of smoking treatment has been low, and therefore its impact has been limited, but new reach strategies such as digital interventions and health care system changes offer great promise. Pharmacotherapy tends to be more effective than psychosocial intervention when used clinically, and newer pharmacotherapy strategies hold great promise of further enhancing effectiveness. However, new approaches are needed to advance psychosocial interventions; progress has stagnated because research and dissemination efforts have focused too narrowly on skill training despite evidence that its core content may be inconsequential and the fact that its mechanisms are either unknown or inconsistent with supporting theory. Identifying effective psychosocial content and its mechanisms of action could greatly enhance the effectiveness of counseling, digital, and web interventions.;,citation_author=Timothy B.

Although much is known, there is still much to be done in mental health research to meaningfully impact disparities. In November 2020, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) co-sponsored a virtual workshop to explore the complexities of mental health disparities, which revealed several gaps and opportunities for the field to pursue to advance mental health disparities research.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurocognitive dysfunction in addiction: Testing hypotheses of diffuse versus selective phenotypic dysfunction with a classification-based approach;,citation_abstract=Neurocognitive dysfunctions are frequently identified in the addictions. These dysfunctions may indicate either diffuse dysfunction or may represent separate facets that have differential importance to the addiction phenotype. In a sample (n = 260) of alcohol and/or stimulant users and controls we measured responses across 7 diverse neurocognitive measures. These measures were Continuous Performance, Delay Discounting, Iowa Gambling, Stroop, Tower, Wisconsin Card Sorting, and Letter Number Sequencing. Comparisons were then made between the drug-dependent groups and controls using analysis of variance and also using a machine learning approach to classify participants based on task performance as substance-dependent or controls in 1 tree and as alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls in a second tree. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups on the Delay Discounting (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001), Iowa Gambling (p &amp;lt; .001), Letter Number Sequencing (p < .001), and Wisconsin Card Sorting (p < .05) tasks. The first classification tree correctly classified between substance-dependent or controls for 88.3% of participants and classified between alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls for 63.9% of participants. Delay discounting was the first split in both trees and in the substance-dependent and control tree. The analysis of variance results largely replicate previous findings. The machine learning classification tree analysis provides evidence to support the hypothesis that different measures of neurocognitive dysfunction represent different processes. Among them, delay discounting was the most robust in categorizing drug dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Warren K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=DALEX: Explainers for Complex Predictive Models in R;,citation_abstract=Predictive modeling is invaded by elastic, yet complex methods such as neural networks or ensembles (model stacking, boosting or bagging). Such methods are usually described by a large number of parameters or hyper parameters - a price that one needs to pay for elasticity. The very number of parameters makes models hard to understand. This paper describes a consistent collection of explainers for predictive models, a.k.a. black boxes. Each explainer is a technique for exploration of a black box model. Presented approaches are model-agnostic, what means that they extract useful information from any predictive method irrespective of its internal structure. Each explainer is linked with a specific aspect of a model. Some are useful in decomposing predictions, some serve better in understanding performance, while others are useful in understanding importance and conditional responses of a particular variable. Every explainer presented here works for a single model or for a collection of models. In the latter case, models can be compared against each other. Such comparison helps to find strengths and weaknesses of different models and gives additional tools for model validation. Presented explainers are implemented in the DALEX package for R. They are based on a uniform standardized grammar of model exploration which may be easily extended.;,citation_author=Przemyslaw Biecek;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=84;,citation_issn=1533-7928;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Machine Learning Research;">

Summary statistics derived from large discovery GWASs can be used to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in independent, target data sets to examine correlates of polygenic disorder liability (e.g., does genetic liability to schizophrenia predict cognition?). The intuitive appeal and generalizability of PRS have led to their widespread use and new insights into mechanisms of polygenic liability. However, when currently applied across traits they account for small amounts of variance (&amp;lt;3%), are relatively uninformative for clinical treatment, and, in isolation, provide no insight into molecular mechanisms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation;,citation_abstract=Background , When people stop smoking they experience cravings to smoke and unpleasant mood changes. Nicotine receptor partial agonists aim to reduce these withdrawal symptoms and the pleasure people usually experience when they smoke. The most widely-available treatment in this drug type is varenicline, which is available world-wide as an aid for quitting smoking. Cytisine is a similar medication, but is only available in Central and Eastern European countries and through internet sales., Study characteristics , We searched for randomised controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisine or dianicline. We found 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. We also found four trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. We include one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a quitting aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the start of treatment. We preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids.We conducted full searches up to May 2015, although we have also included several key trials published after that date., Key findings , From the information we found (27 trials, 12,625 people), varenicline at standard dose more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo. Low-dose varenicline (four trials, 1266 people) roughly doubled the chances of quitting, and reduced the number and severity of side effects. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion (five trials, 5877 people) or with NRT (eight trials, 6264 people). Based on the evidence so far, we can calculate that varenicline delivers one extra successful quitter for every 11 people treated, compared with smokers trying to quit without varenicline., The most common side effect of varenicline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time. People taking varenicline appear to have about a 25% increased chance of a serious adverse event, although these include many which are unrelated to the treatment. We also note that more people were lost from the control groups than from the varenicline groups by the end of the trials, which may mean that the count of events in the control groups is lower than it should be. After varenicline became available to use, there were concerns that it could be linked with an increase in depressed mood, agitation, or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers. However, the latest evidence does not support a link between varenicline and these disorders, although people with past or current psychiatric illness may be at slightly higher risk. There have also been concerns that varenicline may slightly increase heart and circulatory problems in people already at increased risk of these illnesses. The evidence is currently unclear whether or not they are caused or made worse by varenicline, but we should have clearer answers to these questions when a further study is published later this year., Quality of the evidence , The varenicline studies were generally of high quality, providing evidence that we consider to be reliable and robust. We rate the quality of the evidence comparing varenicline with NRT as moderate quality (we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), since in some of them the participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. non-blinded open-label trials). We judge the evidence from the cytsine trials to be of low quality (we have limited confidence in the evidence), as there are only two trials, with relatively low numbers included.;,citation_author=Kate Cahill;,citation_author=Nicola Lindson-Hawley;,citation_author=Kyla H Thomas;,citation_author=Thomas R Fanshawe;,citation_author=Tim Lancaster;,citation_publication_date=2016-05;,citation_cover_date=2016-05;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006103.pub7;,citation_issn=1469-493X;,citation_pmid=27158893;,citation_volume=2016;,citation_journal_title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;">

Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? METHODS: The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with ’smoking’ in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than ’other’ NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from ’other’ NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin’s UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine’s potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.;,citation_author=Kate Cahill;,citation_author=Sarah Stevens;,citation_author=Rafael Perera;,citation_author=Tim Lancaster;,citation_publication_date=2013-05;,citation_cover_date=2013-05;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2;,citation_issn=1469-493X;,citation_pmid=23728690;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimating the number of quit attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully in a longitudinal cohort of smokers;,citation_abstract=Objectives The number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit successfully is a commonly reported figure among smoking cessation programmes, but previous estimates have been based on lifetime recall in cross-sectional samples of successful quitters only. The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations.;,citation_author=Michael Chaiton;,citation_author=Lori Diemert;,citation_author=Joanna E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic Variant in CHRNA5 and Response to Varenicline and Combination Nicotine Replacement in a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=It is unclear if genetic variants affect smoking cessation treatment response. This study tested whether variants in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit (CHRNA5) predict response to smoking cessation medication by directly comparing the two most effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. In this genotype-stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (May 2015–August 2019 in St Louis, Missouri), smokers were randomized by genotype in blocks of six (1:1:1 ratio) to three conditions: 12 weeks of placebo (n = 273), combination nicotine patch and lozenge (combination nicotine replacement therapy, cNRT, n = 275), or varenicline (n = 274). All participants received counseling and were followed for 12 months. The primary end point was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT, week 12). Trial registration and eligibility criteria are on clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT02351167). We conducted the genetic analyses separately for 516 European ancestry (EA) smokers and 306 non-EA smokers (including 270 African American smokers). In African American smokers, there was a genotype-by-treatment interaction for EOT abstinence (\chi2 = 10.7, degrees of freedom = 2. P = 0.0049): specifically, cNRT was more effective in smokers with rs16969968 GG genotype than was placebo, while varenicline was more effective in smokers of GA/AA genotypes. In EA ancestry smokers, there was no significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. In the whole sample, although both were effective at EOT, only varenicline, and not cNRT, was significantly effective relative to placebo at 6-month follow-up. Importantly, this study suggests that genetic information can further enhance smoking cessation treatment effectiveness.;,citation_author=Li-Shiun Chen;,citation_author=Timothy B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Nicotine Metabolite Ratio is Associated With Early Smoking Abstinence Even After Controlling for Factors That Influence the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio;,citation_abstract=The decrease in smoking rates in North America has plateaued, underscoring the need for new approaches to treat nicotine dependence. Inter-individual differences in smoking behavior result, in part, from variation in the rate of CYP2A6 -mediated nicotine metabolism. A phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity is the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), the ratio of 3\primehydroxycotinine/cotinine. The NMR is associated with smoking cessation. However, the NMR is also associated with genetic (eg, CYP2A6 genotype) and other (eg, sex and ethnicity) factors. Here we aimed to determine if previously identified non- CYP2A6 sources of variation in the NMR mitigated the association between the NMR and short-term abstinence. The NMR was determined from blood samples collected at intake from daily smokers aged 18–65. Biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide level \leq 8 ppm) was measured at 1 week following the target quit date in participants from a smoking cessation clinical trial (NCT01314001). Analyses were restricted to N = 462 blacks and N = 693 whites in the intent-to-treat sample. Lower NMR (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.31) was associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence ( OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NMR was associated with 1-week smoking abstinence; NMR may be a useful addition to medication screening approaches evaluating treatments for nicotine dependence.;,citation_author=Meghan J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pathways to precision medicine in smoking cessation treatments;,citation_abstract=Cigarette smoking is highly addictive and modern genetic research has identified robust genetic influences on nicotine dependence. An important step in translating these genetic findings to clinical practice is identifying the genetic factors affecting smoking cessation in order to enhance current smoking cessation treatments. We reviewed the significant genetic variants that predict nicotine dependence, smoking cessation, and response to cessation pharmacotherapy. These data suggest that genetic risks can predict smoking cessation outcomes and moderate the effect of pharmacological treatments. Some pharmacogenetic findings have been replicated in meta-analyses or in multiple smoking cessation trials. The variation in efficacy between smokers with different genetic markers supports the notion that personalized smoking cessation intervention based upon genotype could maximize the efficiency of such treatment while minimizing side effects, thus influencing the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm. In summary, as precision medicine is revolutionizing healthcare, smoking cessation may be one of the first areas where genetic variants may identify individuals at increased risk. Current evidence strongly suggests that genetic variants predict cessation failure and that cessation pharmacotherapy effectiveness is modulated by biomarkers such as nicotinic cholinergic receptor \alpha5 subunit (CHRNA5) genotypes or nicotine metabolism ratio (NMR). These findings strengthen the case for the development and rigorous testing of treatments that target patients with different biological risk profiles.;,citation_author=Li-Shiun Chen;,citation_author=Amy Horton;,citation_author=Laura Bierut;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2016.05.033;,citation_issn=1872-7972;,citation_pmid=27208830;,citation_volume=669;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neuroscience Letters;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Nondegenerate Penalized Likelihood Estimator for Variance Parameters in Multilevel Models;,citation_abstract=Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,\lambda) penalty with \lambda\rightarrow0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior.;,citation_author=Yeojin Chung;,citation_author=Sophia Rabe-Hesketh;,citation_author=Vincent Dorie;,citation_author=Andrew Gelman;,citation_author=Jingchen Liu;,citation_publication_date=2013-10;,citation_cover_date=2013-10;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11336-013-9328-2;,citation_issn=1860-0980;,citation_volume=78;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychometrika;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD): The TRIPOD Statement;,citation_abstract=Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Machine-Learning Approach to Predicting Smoking Cessation Treatment Outcomes;,citation_abstract=Most cigarette smokers want to quit smoking and more than half make an attempt every year, but less than 10% remain abstinent for at least 6 months. Evidence-based tobacco use treatment improves the likelihood of quitting, but more than two-thirds of individuals relapse when provided even the most robust treatments. Identifying for whom treatment is effective will improve the success of our treatments and perhaps identify strategies for improving current approaches.Two cohorts (training: N = 90, validation: N = 71) of cigarette smokers enrolled in group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify baseline predictors of outcome, as defined by breath carbon monoxide and urine cotinine. Significant measures were entered as candidate variables to predict quit status. The resulting decision trees were used to predict cessation outcomes in a validation cohort.In the training cohort, the decision trees significantly improved on chance classification of smoking status following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The first split of all decision trees, which was delay discounting, significantly improved on chance classification rates in both the training and validation cohort. Delay discounting emerged as the single best predictor of group CBT treatment response with an average baseline discount rate of ln(k) = -7.1, correctly predicting smoking status of 80% of participants at posttreatment and 81% of participants at follow-up.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation though future work is needed to identify individuals that are likely to be successful in treatments beyond group CBT.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether In vivo nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling approach increases NRT adherence among criminal justice smokers during a subsequent quit attempt. Methods We conducted a pilot study with 43 community corrections smokers randomized to a 4-session (one 30-min session per week) precessation intervention of either In vivo NRT sampling (Session 1: patch; Session 2: gum; Session 3: combination NRT (cNRT); Session 4: review) vs. 4 time-matched sessions of standard smoking cessation with cNRT started after Session 1. Both groups received an additional 8weeks of cNRT following the four intervention sessions. Results During the in vivo administration of NRT, total withdrawal and craving severity significantly decreased from pre- to post-session compared to Control participants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The history, current status, and possible future of precision mental health;,citation_abstract=In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems.

Five pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response (marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression models, permitting the calculation of each patient’s Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units. RESULTS: For 60% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI\geq3) was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their &amp;amp;amp;quot;Optimal&amp;quot; treatment versus those assigned to their &quot;Non-optimal&quot; treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d\mkern1mu=\mkern1mu0.58, 95% CI .17-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: This approach to treatment selection, implemented in the context of two equally effective treatments, yielded effects that, if obtained prospectively, would rival those routinely observed in comparisons of active versus control treatments.;,citation_author=Robert J.

This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes, and leverages genome-wide information. Our results include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits; a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers; and many cell-type-specific enrichments including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment, and smoking behavior.;,citation_author=Hilary K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Association of nicotine metabolism and sex with relapse following varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy;,citation_abstract=Nicotine is metabolized into cotinine and then into trans-3\prime-hydroxycotinine, mainly by cytochrome P450 2A6. Recent studies reported better effectiveness of varenicline in women and in nicotine normal metabolizers phenotypically determined by nicotine-metabolite ratio. Our objective was to study the influence of nicotine-metabolite ratio, CYP2A6 genotype and sex on the response to nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline. Data were extracted from a longitudinal study which included smokers participating in a smoking cessation program. Response to treatment was defined by the absence of relapse when a set threshold of reduction in cigarettes per day relative to the week before the study was no more reached. The analysis considered total and partial reduction defined by a diminution of 100% and of 90% in cigarettes per day, respectively. The hazard ratio of relapsing was estimated in multivariate Cox regression models including the sex and the nicotine metabolism determined by the phenotype or by CYP2A6 genotyping (rs1801272 and rs28399433). In the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping and in women, the hazard ratio for relapsing was significantly lower with varenicline for a partial decrease (HR = 0.33, 95% CI [0.12, 0.89] and HR = 0.20, 95% CI [0.04, 0.91], respectively) and nonsignificantly lower for a total cessation (HR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.20, 1.0] and HR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.14, 1.0]). When compared with the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping, the hazard ratio for a partial decrease was similar in the normal metabolizers determined by genotyping (HR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.18, 0.94]) while it was significantly lower with varenicline for a total cessation (HR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.26, 0.98]).

However, little is known about cigarette use among justice-involved youth, especially youth supervised in the community where there is ample opportunity to smoke. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the associations between cigarette smoking, emotional and behavioral functioning, and other substance use among a sample of first-time offending court-involved, non-incarcerated (FTO-CINI) youth. Methods: Youth were recruited from a family court in the Northeast (N = 423). Substance use was self-reported using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA). Emotional and behavioral functioning was measured using the Behavior Assessment Schedule for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2), the Affect Dysregulation Scale (ADS), National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS), and the National Survey of Self-Reported Delinquency (NYS-SRD). Results: About 9.9% of FTO-CINI youth had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. Compared with FTO-CINI youth who had not smoked recently, recent smokers endorsed more emotional and behavioral symptoms, such as school problems (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001), internalizing problems (p = .012), inattention/hyperactivity (p = .020), affect dysregulation (p = .044), PTSD symptoms (p = .006), and delinquent behavior (p &amp;lt; .001). Recent smokers were also more likely to use alcohol (OR = 5.61, p < .001), marijuana (OR = 11.27, p < .001), and other drugs (OR = 5.00, p < .001). Conclusions: Recent smoking was higher among FTO-CINI youth than youth in the general population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Switching Smoking-Cessation Medications Following Relapse;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Nicotine dependence is a chronic disorder often characterized by multiple failed quit attempts (QAs). Yet, little is known about the sequence of methods used across multiple QAs or how this may impact future ability to abstain from smoking. This prospective cohort study examines the effectiveness of switching smoking-cessation medications (SCMs) across multiple QAs. METHODS: Adult smokers (aged \geq18 years) participating in International Tobacco Control surveys in the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada, and Australia (N=795) who: (1) completed two consecutive surveys between 2006 and 2011; (2) initiated a QA at least 1 month before each survey; and (3) provided data for the primary predictor (SCM use during most recent QA), outcome (1-month point prevalence abstinence), and relevant covariates. Analyses were conducted in 2016. RESULTS: Five SCM user classifications were identified: (1) non-users (43.5%); (2) early users (SCM used for initial, but not subsequent QA; 11.4%); (3) later users (SCM used for subsequent, but not initial QA; 18.4%); (4) repeaters (same SCM used for both QAs; 10.7%); and (5) switchers (different SCM used for each QA; 14.2%). Abstinence rates were lower for non-users (15.9%, OR=0.48, p=0.002), early users (16.6%, OR=0.27, p=0.03), and repeaters (12.4%, OR=0.36, p=0.004) relative to switchers (28.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest smokers will be more successful if they use a SCM in QAs and vary the SCM they use across time. That smokers can increase their odds of quitting by switching SCMs is an important message that could be communicated to smokers.;,citation_author=Bryan W. Heckman;,citation_author=K.

No treatment was provided.Most smokers (60%) made multiple transitions among smoking, reduction, and abstinence. Intention to not smoke or quit often did not result in a quit attempt but were still strong predictors of a quit attempt and eventual abstinence. Most quit attempts (79%) lasted less than 1 day; about one fifth (18%) of the participants were abstinent at 12 weeks. The majority of quit attempts (72%) were not preceded by an intention to quit. Such quit attempts were shorter than quit attempts preceded by an intention to quit (&amp;amp;amp;lt;1 day vs. 25 days). Most smokers (67%) used a treatment, and use of a treatment was nonsignificantly associated with greater abstinence (14 days vs. 3 days). Making a quit attempt and failing early predicted an increased probability of a later quit attempt compared to not making a quit attempt early (86% vs. 67%).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for human complex diseases;,citation_abstract=Genetic risk prediction is an important goal in human genetics research and precision medicine. Accurate prediction models will have great impacts on both disease prevention and early treatment strategies. Despite the identification of thousands of disease-associated genetic variants through genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk prediction accuracy remains moderate for most diseases, which is largely due to the challenges in both identifying all the functionally relevant variants and accurately estimating their effect sizes in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper, we introduce AnnoPred, a principled framework that leverages diverse types of genomic and epigenomic functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for complex diseases. AnnoPred is trained using GWAS summary statistics in a Bayesian framework in which we explicitly model various functional annotations and allow for linkage disequilibrium estimated from reference genotype data. Compared with state-of-the-art risk prediction methods, AnnoPred achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy in both extensive simulations and real data.;,citation_author=Yiming Hu;,citation_author=Qiongshi Lu;,citation_author=Ryan Powles;,citation_author=Xinwei Yao;,citation_author=Can Yang;,citation_author=Fang Fang;,citation_author=Xinran Xu;,citation_author=Hongyu Zhao;,citation_publication_date=2017-06;,citation_cover_date=2017-06;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005589;,citation_issn=1553-7358;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS Computational Biology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning application for predicting smoking cessation among US adults: An analysis of waves 1-3 of the PATH study;,citation_abstract=Identifying determinants of smoking cessation is critical for developing optimal cessation treatments and interventions. Machine learning (ML) is becoming more prevalent for smoking cessation success prediction in treatment programs. However, only individuals with an intention to quit smoking cigarettes participate in such programs, which limits the generalizability of the results. This study applies data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), a United States longitudinal nationally representative survey, to select primary determinants of smoking cessation and to train ML classification models for predicting smoking cessation among the general population. An analytical sample of 9,281 adult current established smokers from the PATH survey wave 1 was used to develop classification models to predict smoking cessation by wave 2. Random forest and gradient boosting machines were applied for variable selection, and the SHapley Additive explanation method was used to show the effect direction of the top-ranked variables. The final model predicted wave 2 smoking cessation for current established smokers in wave 1 with an accuracy of 72% in the test dataset. The validation results showed that a similar model could predict wave 3 smoking cessation of wave 2 smokers with an accuracy of 70%. Our analysis indicated that more past 30 days e-cigarette use at the time of quitting, fewer past 30 days cigarette use before quitting, ages older than 18 at smoking initiation, fewer years of smoking, poly tobacco past 30-days use before quitting, and higher BMI resulted in higher chances of cigarette cessation for adult smokers in the US.;,citation_author=Mona Issabakhsh;,citation_author=Luz Maria Sánchez-Romero;,citation_author=Thuy T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Discovery and development of varenicline for smoking cessation;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Tobacco use causes one premature death every six seconds. Current smoking cessation aids include nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion. Although more than 70% of smokers express a desire to quit, fewer than 3% remain abstinent for more than one year, highlighting a critical need for more efficacious smoking cessation treatments. Areas Covered: The authors discuss the rationale, preclinical and clinical development of varenicline for smoking cessation. They cover the formulation of varenicline as a partial agonist at \alpha4\beta2 receptors, the primary neural substrate for nicotine reward. Then, they discuss evidence from preclinical studies indicating varenicline’s efficacy in blocking nicotine reward, followed by clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in sustaining abstinence in smokers. Finally, they cover post-market surveillance, including contraindications in heavy machine operators, putative cardiovascular risk, and the repealed warning for adverse neuropsychiatric events. Expert opinion: Varenicline development was based on strong theoretical rationale and preclinical evidence. Clinical studies indicate that varenicline is safe and more effective in sustaining abstinence than placebo, bupropion or nicotine replacement therapies. However, given that continuous abstinence rates across studies remain low (18~30% with varenicline; 4~10% with placebo), novel and more effective medications targeting other nicotinic or glutamate receptors for smoking cessation are required.;,citation_author=Chloe J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rate of Nicotine Metabolism and Smoking Cessation Outcomes in a Community-based Sample of Treatment-Seeking Smokers;,citation_abstract=Background In samples from controlled randomized clinical trials, a smoker’s rate of nicotine metabolism, measured by the 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio (NMR), predicts response to transdermal nicotine. Replication of this relationship in community-based samples of treatment-seeking smokers may help guide the implementation of the NMR for personalized treatment for nicotine dependence. Methods Data from a community-based sample of treatment seeking smokers (N=499) who received 8weeks of transdermal nicotine and 4 behavioral counseling sessions were used to evaluate associations between the NMR and smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes included withdrawal and craving, depression and anxiety, side effects, and treatment adherence. Results The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR=.56, 95% CI: 0.33-0.95, p=.03), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates than slower metabolizers (24% vs. 33%). Faster nicotine metabolizers exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms over time during treatment, vs. slower metabolizers (NMR x Time interaction: F[3,357]=3.29, p=.02). NMR was not associated with changes in withdrawal, craving, depression, side effects, and treatment adherence (p’s&amp;amp;amp;gt;.05). Conclusions In a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers, faster nicotine metabolizers were significantly less likely to quit smoking and showed higher rates of anxiety symptoms during a smoking cessation treatment program, vs. slower nicotine metabolizers. These results provide further evidence that transdermal nicotine is less effective for faster nicotine metabolizers and suggest the need to address cessation-induced anxiety symptoms among these smokers to increase the chances for successful smoking cessation.;,citation_author=Amanda Kaufmann;,citation_author=Brian Hitsman;,citation_author=Patricia M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Searching for Personalized Medicine for Binge Drinking Smokers: Smoking Cessation Using Varenicline, Nicotine Patch, or Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy;,citation_abstract=Objective: Heavy drinking is common among smokers and is associated with especially poor health outcomes. Varenicline may affect mechanisms and clinical outcomes that are relevant for both smoking cessation and alcohol use. The current study examines whether varenicline, relative to nicotine replacement therapy, yields better smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinking smokers. Method: Secondary data analyses of a comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of three smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (12 weeks of varenicline, nicotine patch, or nicotine patch and lozenge) paired with six counseling sessions were conducted. Adult daily cigarette smokers (N = 1,078, 52% female) reported patterns of alcohol use, cigarette craving, and alcohol-related cigarette craving at baseline and over 4 weeks after quitting. Smoking cessation outcome was 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Results: Binge drinkers had higher relapse rates than moderate drinkers at 4-week post-target quit day but not at the end of treatment or long-term follow up (12 and 26 weeks). Varenicline did not yield superior smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinkers, nor did it affect alcohol use early in the quit attempt. Varenicline did produce relatively large reductions in alcohol-related cigarette craving and overall cigarette craving during the first 4 weeks after quitting. Conclusions: Varenicline did not yield higher smoking abstinence rates or reduce alcohol use among binge drinkers. Varenicline did reduce alcohol-related cigarette craving but this did not translate to meaningful differences in smoking abstinence. Varenicline’s effects on smoking abstinence do not appear to vary significantly as a function of drinking status.;,citation_author=Jesse T. Kaye;,citation_author=Adrienne L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence of smoking and other health risk factors in people attending residential substance abuse treatment;,citation_abstract=Introduction and Aims. People attending substance abuse treatment have an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Consequently, there have been increasing calls for substance abuse treatment services to address smoking. The current study examined smoking behaviours of people attending residential substance abuse treatment. Additionally, the study examined rates of other potentially modifiable health risk factors for the development of CVD and cancer. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional survey was completed by participants attending Australian Salvation Army residential substance abuse treatment services (n = 228). Rates of smoking, exercise, dietary fat intake, body mass index and depression were identified and compared with representative community populations. The relationship between length of treatment and changes in these variables was also examined. Results. When compared with the Australian population, participants were much more likely to be current smokers. They also showed higher rates of dietary fat intake, and having had a previous diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Encouragingly, participants were more likely to be engaging in regular exercise. Over a third of all smokers reported having increased their smoking since attending the residential program, with correlational analysis suggesting that nicotine dependence was increasing the longer participants were in treatment. Discussion and Conclusions. People attending substance abuse treatment show extremely high rates of smoking (77%). With the large majority of participants showing multiple risk factors for CVD, it is important that residential services consider strategies to address smoking and the other potentially modifiable health risk factors in an integrated fashion.[Kelly PJ, Baker AL, Deane FP, Kay-Lambkin FJ, Bonevski B, Tregarthen J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pragmatic Precision Psychiatry—A New Direction for Optimizing Treatment Selection;,citation_abstract=Clinical trials have identified numerous prescriptive predictors of mental disorder treatment response, ie, predictors of which treatments are best for which patients. However, none of these prescriptive predictors is strong enough alone to guide precision treatment planning. This has prompted growing interest in developing precision treatment rules (PTRs) that combine information across multiple prescriptive predictors, but this work has been much less successful in psychiatry than some other areas of medicine. Study designs and analysis schemes used in research on PTR development in other areas of medicine are reviewed, key challenges for implementing similar studies of mental disorders are highlighted, and recent methodological advances to address these challenges are described here.Discovering prescriptive predictors requires large samples. Three approaches have been used in other areas of medicine to do this: conduct very large randomized clinical trials, pool individual-level results across multiple smaller randomized clinical trials, and develop preliminary PTRs in large observational treatment samples that are then tested in smaller randomized clinical trials. The third approach is most feasible for research on mental disorders. This approach requires working with large real-world observational electronic health record databases; carefully selecting samples to emulate trials; extracting information about prescriptive predictors from electronic health records along with other inexpensive data augmentation strategies; estimating preliminary PTRs in the observational data using appropriate methods; implementing pragmatic trials to validate the preliminary PTRs; and iterating between subsequent observational studies and quality improvement pragmatic trials to refine and expand the PTRs. New statistical methods exist to address the methodological challenges of implementing this approach.Advances in pragmatic precision psychiatry will require moving beyond the current focus on randomized clinical trials and adopting an iterative discovery-confirmation process that integrates observational and experimental studies in real-world clinical populations.;,citation_author=Ronald C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detecting recovery problems just in time: Application of automated linguistic analysis and supervised machine learning to an online substance abuse forum;,citation_abstract=Background: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or “moderators”) may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. Objective: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. Methods: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. Results: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (“drink,” “relapse,” “depression,” and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery. Conclusions: Differences in language use can distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive issues.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Precision medicine and pharmacogenetics: What does oncology have that addiction medicine does not?;,citation_abstract=Background and aims Precision, personalized or stratified medicine, which promises to deliver the right treatment to the right patient, is a topic of international interest in both the lay press and the scientific literature. A key aspect of precision medicine is the identification of biomarkers that predict the response to medications (i.e. pharmacogenetics). We examined why, despite the great strides that have been made in biomarker identification in many areas of medicine, only in oncology has there been substantial progress in their clinical implementation. We also considered why progress in this effort has lagged in addiction medicine. Methods We compared the development of pharmacogenetic biomarkers in oncology, cardiovascular medicine (where developments are also promising) and addictive disorders. Results The first major reason for the success of oncologic pharmacogenetics is ready access to tumor tissue, which allows in-vitro testing and insights into cancer biology. The second major reason is funding, with cancer research receiving, by far, the largest allocation by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) during the past two decades. The second largest allocation of research funding has gone to cardiovascular disease research. Addictions research received a much smaller NIH funding allocation, despite the major impact that tobacco use, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use have on the public health and healthcare costs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cross-validation pitfalls when selecting and assessing regression and classification models;,citation_abstract=Background We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. Methods We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. Results We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. Conclusions We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development of Machine Learning Models for Prediction of Smoking Cessation Outcome;,citation_abstract=Predictors for success in smoking cessation have been studied, but a prediction model capable of providing a success rate for each patient attempting to quit smoking is still lacking. The aim of this study is to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of smoking cessation. Data was acquired from patients underwent smoking cessation program at one medical center in Northern Taiwan. A total of 4875 enrollments fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Models with artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and naïve Bayes (NB) were trained to predict the final smoking status of the patients in a six-month period. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC or ROC value) were used to determine the performance of the models. We adopted the ANN model which reached a slightly better performance, with a sensitivity of 0.704, a specificity of 0.567, an accuracy of 0.640, and an ROC value of 0.660 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.617–0.702) for prediction in smoking cessation outcome. A predictive model for smoking cessation was constructed. The model could aid in providing the predicted success rate for all smokers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Initiating Pharmacologic Treatment in Tobacco-Dependent Adults. An Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline;,citation_abstract=Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely confront treatment teams. Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations. Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.;,citation_author=Frank T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of the nicotine metabolite ratio as a genetically informed biomarker of response to nicotine patch or varenicline for smoking cessation: A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Substantial variability exists in therapeutic response and adverse effects with pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence. Biomarkers to optimise treatment choice for individual smokers might improve treatment outcomes. We tested whether a genetically informed biomarker of nicotine clearance, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3’-hydroxycotinine:cotinine), predicts response to nicotine patch or varenicline for smoking cessation. METHODS: We undertook NMR-stratified multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial from Nov 16, 2010, to Sept 12, 2014, at four sites. Smokers seeking treatment were randomly assigned by baseline NMR status and study site, in blocks of 12 patients (1:1:1 ratio), to 11 weeks of placebo (placebo pill plus placebo patch), nicotine patch (active patch plus placebo pill), or varenicline (active pill plus placebo patch), plus behavioural counselling. Participants and investigators were masked to group allocation and NMR status. An intention-to-treat analysis was done. Participants were followed up for 12 months after the target quit date. The primary endpoint was biochemically verified 7 day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment to estimate the pharmacological effect of treatment by NMR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01314001. FINDINGS: 1246 participants (662 slow metabolisers of nicotine, 584 normal metabolisers of nicotine) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three interventions (408 placebo, 418 nicotine patch, 420 varenicline). At end of treatment, varenicline was more efficacious than nicotine patch in normal metabolisers (OR 2\cdot17, 95% CI 1\cdot38-3\cdot42; p=0\cdot001), but not in slow metabolisers (OR 1\cdot13, 0\cdot74-1\cdot71; p=0\cdot56). In the longitudinal model including all timepoints, the NMR-by-treatment interaction was significant (ratio of odds ratios [ORR] 1\cdot96, 95% CI 1\cdot11-3\cdot46; p=0\cdot02). An NMR-by-treatment interaction showed that slow (vs normal) metabolisers reported greater overall side-effect severity with varenicline versus placebo (\beta=-1\cdot06, 95% CI -2\cdot08 to -0\cdot03; p=0\cdot044). INTERPRETATION: Treating normal metabolisers with varenicline and slow metabolisers with nicotine patch could optimise quit rates while minimising side-effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties.

ADHD is more prevalent in patients with substance use disorders, and this pattern is consistent across different substances of abuse. Individuals with SUDs and ADHD exhibit significant variations in their clinical presentations. The developmental trajectory of ADHD to SUDs is complex: ADHD symptoms appear first in some patients but not in others. Many patients present with a heterogeneous collection of psychiatric and substance use co-morbidities, and these symptoms change over time. ADHD symptom severity is also highly variable, and more severe ADHD symptoms worsen co-morbid SUDs and complicate treatment. New longitudinal studies with innovative methods in high-risk populations and in community-based samples may clarify issues related to patient-treatment matching. When closely monitored, psychostimulant and other adjunct medications can be safely used to treat ADHD in this population, and such treatment may also improve outcome of SUDs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning for precision medicine;,citation_abstract=Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine’s multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Applicability of machine learning algorithm to predict the therapeutic intervention success in Brazilian smokers;,citation_abstract=Smoking cessation is an important public health policy worldwide. However, as far as we know, there is a lack of screening of variables related to the success of therapeutic intervention (STI) in Brazilian smokers by machine learning (ML) algorithms. To address this gap in the literature, we evaluated the ability of eight ML algorithms to correctly predict the STI in Brazilian smokers who were treated at a smoking cessation program in Brazil between 2006 and 2017. The dataset was composed of 12 variables and the efficacies of the algorithms were measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We plotted a decision tree flowchart and also measured the odds ratio (OR) between each independent variable and the outcome, and the importance of the variable for the best model based on PPV. The mean global values for the metrics described above were, respectively, 0.6750.028, 0.8030.078, 0.4850.146, 0.7050.035 and 0.6800.033. Supporting vector machines performed the best algorithm with a PPV of 0.7260.031. Smoking cessation drug use was the roof of decision tree with OR of 4.42 and importance of variable of 100.00. Increase in the number of relapses also promoted a positive outcome, while higher consumption of cigarettes resulted in the opposite. In summary, the best model predicted 72.6% of positive outcomes correctly. Smoking cessation drug use and higher number of relapses contributed to quit smoking, while higher consumption of cigarettes showed the opposite effect. There are important strategies to reduce the number of smokers and increase STI by increasing services and drug treatment for smokers.;,citation_author=Miyoko Massago;,citation_author=Mamoru Massago;,citation_author=Pedro Henrique Iora;,citation_author=Sanderland José Tavares Gurgel;,citation_author=Celso Ivam Conegero;,citation_author=Idalina Diair Regla Carolino;,citation_author=Maria Muzanila Mushi;,citation_author=Giane Aparecida Chaves Forato;,citation_author=João Vitor Perez Souza;,citation_author=Thiago Augusto Hernandes Rocha;,citation_author=Samile Bonfim;,citation_author=Catherine Ann Staton;,citation_author=Oscar Kenji Nihei;,citation_author=João Ricardo Nickenig Vissoci;,citation_author=Luciano Andrade;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0295970;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=38437221;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS One;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Successful classification of cocaine dependence using brain imaging: A generalizable machine learning approach;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have yielded significant advances in the understanding of neural processes relevant to the development and persistence of addiction. However, these advances have not explored extensively for diagnostic accuracy in human subjects. The aim of this study was to develop a statistical approach, using a machine learning framework, to correctly classify brain images of cocaine-dependent participants and healthy controls. In this study, a framework suitable for educing potential brain regions that differed between the two groups was developed and implemented. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) images obtained during rest or a saline infusion in three cohorts of 2-4 week abstinent cocaine-dependent participants (n = 93) and healthy controls (n = 69) were used to develop a classification model. An information theoretic-based feature selection algorithm was first conducted to reduce the number of voxels. A density-based clustering algorithm was then used to form spatially connected voxel clouds in three-dimensional space. A statistical classifier, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), was then used for participant classification. Statistically insignificant voxels of spatially connected brain regions were removed iteratively and classification accuracy was reported through the iterations. RESULTS: The voxel-based analysis identified 1,500 spatially connected voxels in 30 distinct clusters after a grid search in SVM parameters. Participants were successfully classified with 0.88 and 0.89&nbsp;F-measure accuracies in 10-fold cross validation (10xCV) and leave-one-out (LOO) approaches, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.90 and 0.89 for LOO; 0.83 and 0.83 for 10xCV. Many of the 30 selected clusters are highly relevant to the addictive process, including regions relevant to cognitive control, default mode network related self-referential thought, behavioral inhibition, and contextual memories. Relative hyperactivity and hypoactivity of regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions in cocaine-dependent participants are presented with corresponding level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: The SVM-based approach successfully classified cocaine-dependent and healthy control participants using voxels selected with information theoretic-based and statistical methods from participants’ SPECT data. The regions found in this study align with brain regions reported in the literature. These findings support the future use of brain imaging and SVM-based classifier in the diagnosis of substance use disorders and furthering an understanding of their underlying pathology.;,citation_author=Mutlu Mete;,citation_author=Unal Sakoglu;,citation_author=Jeffrey S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting population health with machine learning: A scoping review;,citation_abstract=Objective To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. Design A scoping review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. Eligibility criteria We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. Data extraction and synthesis We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. Results Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). Conclusions Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations, Small-Molecule Kinase Inhibitors, and Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Current Knowledge and Future Directions;,citation_abstract=Purpose Gefitinib and erlotinib are small molecules that selectively inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity. When these drugs were introduced into the clinic, the specific targets affected in human tumors were unknown. In April 2004, two groups reported that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are strongly associated with gefitinib sensitivity in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We subsequently extended these findings and showed that such mutations are also associated with sensitivity to erlotinib. Here, we present current knowledge about EGFR mutations in the context of clinical trials involving gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC. Design This article reviews the rationale for targeting EGFR, the development of gefitinib and erlotinib, the discovery of EGFR mutations, and subsequent studies to define the incidence, spectrum, and functions of EGFR mutations. Results The discovery of EGFR mutations promises to alter the ways in which we consider and treat NSCLC. Conclusion This information can guide practitioners and help them inform their patients about EGFR mutations and their impact on the treatment of NSCLC.;,citation_author=William Pao;,citation_author=Vincent A.

We applied support vector machine-based classification to resting state functional connectivity data from nicotine-dependent smokers and healthy controls to identify brain-based features predictive of nicotine dependence. By employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in predicting smoking status. Our findings suggest that machine learning-based approaches to classifying resting state functional connectivity data offer a valuable alternative technique to understanding large-scale differences in addiction-related neurobiology.;,citation_author=Vani Pariyadath;,citation_author=Elliot A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Quitting Rollercoaster: How Recent Quitting History Affects Future Cessation Outcomes (Data From the International Tobacco Control 4-Country Cohort Study);,citation_abstract=Most smokers have a history of unsuccessful quit attempts. This study used data from 7 waves (2002–2009) of the International Tobacco Control 4-country cohort study to examine the role of smokers’ quitting history (e.g., recency, length, and number of previous quit attempts) on their subsequent likelihood of making a quit attempt and achieving at least 6 months of sustained abstinence.Generalized estimating equations were used, allowing for estimation of relationships between variables across repeated observations while controlling for correlations from multiple responses by the same individual (29,682 observations from 13,417 individuals).The likelihood of a future quit attempt increased independently with recency and number of prior attempts. By contrast, the likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence of at least 6 months was reduced for smokers with a failed quit attempt within the last year (15.1% vs. 27.1% for those without, p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001). Two or more failed attempts (vs. only one) in the previous year were also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.85). Effects persisted after controlling for levels of addiction, self-efficacy to quit, and use of stop-smoking medications.There appears to be a subset of smokers who repeatedly attempt but fail to remain abstinent from tobacco. Understanding why repeated attempts might be less successful in the long term is an important research priority because it implies a need to tailor treatment approaches for those who are motivated to quit but persistently relapse back to smoking.;,citation_author=Timea R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classification of Lapses in Smokers Attempting to Stop: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach Using Data From a Popular Smoking Cessation Smartphone App;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Smoking lapses after the quit date often lead to full relapse. To inform the development of real time, tailored lapse prevention support, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports. AIMS AND METHODS: We used data from app users with \geq20 unprompted data entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (eg, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample (1) observations and (2) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested. RESULTS: Participants (N = 791) provided 37 002 data entries (7.6% lapses). The best-performing group-level algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.961 to 0.978). Its ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample individuals ranged from poor to excellent (AUC = 0.482-1.000). Individual-level algorithms could be constructed for 39/791 participants with sufficient data, with a median AUC of 0.938 (range: 0.518-1.000). Hybrid algorithms could be constructed for 184/791 participants and had a median AUC of 0.825 (range: 0.375-1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual’s dataset, in addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of each individual’s data, had improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. IMPLICATIONS: This study used routinely collected data from a popular smartphone app to train and test a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse events. Although a high-performing group-level algorithm was developed, it had variable performance when applied to new, unseen individuals. Individual-level and hybrid algorithms had somewhat greater performance but could not be constructed for all participants because of the lack of variability in the outcome measure. Triangulation of results with those from a prompted study design is recommended prior to intervention development, with real-world lapse prediction likely requiring a balance between unprompted and prompted app data.;,citation_author=Olga Perski;,citation_author=Kezhi Li;,citation_author=Nikolas Pontikos;,citation_author=David Simons;,citation_author=Stephanie P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying effective intervention components for smoking cessation: A factorial screening experiment;,citation_abstract=AIMS: To identify promising intervention components intended to help smokers to attain and maintain abstinence in their quit smoking attempts. DESIGN: A fully crossed, six-factor randomized fractional factorial experiment. SETTING: Eleven primary care clinics in southern Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 637 adult smokers (55% women, 88% white) motivated to quit smoking who visited primary care clinics. INTERVENTIONS: Six intervention components designed to prepare smokers to quit, and achieve and maintain abstinence (i.e. for the preparation, cessation and maintenance phases of smoking treatment): (1) preparation nicotine patch versus none; (2) preparation nicotine gum versus none; (3) preparation counseling versus none; (4) intensive cessation in-person counseling versus minimal; (5) intensive cessation telephone counseling versus minimal; and (6) 16 versus 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch  +  nicotine gum). MEASUREMENTS: Seven-day self-reported point-prevalence abstinence at 16 weeks. FINDINGS: Preparation counseling significantly improved week 16 abstinence rates (P = .04), while both forms of preparation nicotine replacement therapy interacted synergistically with intensive cessation in-person counseling (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conversely, intensive cessation phone counseling and intensive cessation in-person counseling interacted antagonistically (P &amp;lt; 0.05)-these components produced higher abstinence rates by themselves than in combination.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward precision smoking cessation treatment II: Proximal effects of smoking cessation intervention components on putative mechanisms of action;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Understanding how smoking cessation treatments exert their effects can inform treatment development and use. Factorial designs allow researchers to examine whether multiple intervention components affect hypothesized change mechanisms, and whether the affected mechanisms are related to cessation. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of smokers recruited during primary care visits (N=637, 55% women, 87% white) who were motivated to quit. Participants in this fractional factorial experiment were randomized to one level of each of six intervention factors: Prequit Nicotine Patch vs None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs None, Preparation Counseling vs None, Intensive In-Person Counseling vs Minimal, Intensive Phone Counseling vs Minimal, and 16 vs 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement (nicotine patch+nicotine gum). Data on putative mechanisms (e.g., medication use, withdrawal, self-efficacy) and smoking status were gathered using daily assessments and during follow-up assessment calls. RESULTS: Some intervention components influenced hypothesized mechanisms. Prequit Gum and Patch each reduced prequit smoking and enhanced prequit coping and self-efficacy. In-Person Counseling increased prequit motivation to quit, postquit self-efficacy, and postquit perceived intratreatment support. Withdrawal reduction and reduced prequit smoking produced the strongest effects on cessation. The significant effect of combining Prequit Gum and In-Person Counseling on 26-week abstinence was mediated by increased prequit self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This factorial experiment identified which putative treatment mechanisms were influenced by discrete intervention components and which mechanisms influenced cessation. Such information supports the combined use of prequit nicotine gum and intensive in-person counseling as cessation interventions that operate via increased prequit self-efficacy.;,citation_author=Megan E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward precision smoking cessation treatment I: Moderator results from a factorial experiment;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: The development of tobacco use treatments that are effective for all smokers is critical to improving clinical and public health. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate multiple intervention components for possible inclusion in an optimized tobacco use treatment. Factorial experiments permit analyses of the influence of patient characteristics on main and interaction effects of multiple, relatively discrete, intervention components. This study examined whether person-factor and smoking characteristics moderated the main or interactive effects of intervention components on 26-week self-reported abstinence rates. METHODS: This fractional factorial experiment evaluated six smoking cessation intervention components among primary care patients (N=637): Prequit Nicotine Patch vs. None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs. None, Preparation Counseling vs. None, Intensive Cessation In-Person Counseling vs. Minimal, Intensive Cessation Telephone Counseling vs. Minimal, and 16 vs. 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT; nicotine patch+nicotine gum). RESULTS: Both psychiatric history and smoking heaviness moderated intervention component effects. In comparison with participants with no self-reported history of a psychiatric disorder, those with a positive history showed better response to 16- vs. 8-weeks of combination NRT, but a poorer response to counseling interventions. Also, in contrast to light smokers, heavier smokers showed a poorer response to counseling interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy smokers and those with psychiatric histories demonstrated a differential response to intervention components. This research illustrates the use of factorial designs to examine the interactions between person characteristics and relatively discrete intervention components.

It focuses on (1) the main effects of the three Project MATCH treatments, (2) the prognostic value of client attributes employed in the matching hypotheses, and (3) the attribute by treatment interaction effects. METHOD: Clients recruited from outpatient settings (n = 952) or from aftercare settings (n = 774) were randomized to one of the following treatments: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Alcohol consumption and psychosocial functioning during treatment were assessed at the end of the 12-week treatment phase. RESULTS: During the treatment phase, small but statistically significant differences among treatments were found only in the outpatient arm on measures of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Forty-one percent (41%) of CBT and TSF clients were abstinent or drank moderately without alcohol-related consequences, compared with 28% of MET clients. Tests of 10 a priori primary client-treatment matching hypotheses failed to find any interaction effects that had an impact on drinking throughout the treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: In the outpatient setting there appears to be a temporary advantage to assigning individuals to CBT or TSF rather than MET. When there is a need to quickly reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related consequences, it appears that CBT or TSF should be the treatment of choice.;,citation_author=Project Match Research Group;,citation_publication_date=1998-11;,citation_cover_date=1998-11;,citation_year=1998;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.1998.59.631;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_pmid=9811084;,citation_volume=59;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment of Tobacco Smoking: A Review;,citation_abstract=More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician’s brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.;,citation_author=Nancy A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reasons and clinical outcomes of antipsychotic treatment switch in outpatients with schizophrenia in real-life clinical settings: The ETOS observational study;,citation_abstract=Background Patients under antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia commonly exhibit poor adherence to treatment, high rates of treatment discontinuation, and frequent treatment changes. The ETOS study aimed to identify the reasons leading physicians to decide to switch antipsychotic treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia and to evaluate the outcome of this switch. Methods ETOS was an observational 18-week (four visits) study in outpatients 18 to 65&nbsp;years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition criteria at least 6&nbsp;months prior to enrolment, who were initiated on a new antipsychotic monotherapy treatment within the 2&nbsp;weeks prior to enrollment. A total of 574 patients were recruited by 87 hospital- and office-based physicians. Ethical approval was obtained prior to study initiation (NCT00999895). Results The final analysis included 568 patients, 39.0  11.2&nbsp;years old with mean disease duration of 11.7&nbsp;years. The male-to-female ratio was 53:47. The main reason for switching antipsychotic treatment was lack of tolerability (n = 369, 65.0%), followed by lack of efficacy (n = 249, 43.8%). Following treatment switch, 87.9% of patients (n = 499) showed meaningful clinical benefit by achieving a Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit score of \leq4 at the final visit.

The process of smoking cessation comprises different pragmatically defined phases, and these can help guide smoking treatment development and evaluation. This review evaluates the effectiveness of smoking interventions for smokers who are unwilling to make a quit attempt (Motivation Phase), who are willing to make a quit attempt (Cessation Phase), who have recently quit (Maintenance Phase), and who have recently relapsed (Relapse Recovery Phase). Multiple effective treatments exist for some phases (Cessation), but not others (Relapse Recovery).

Controlling for sex, race, age, and nicotine dependence, smokers in the upper 3 quartiles of 3-HC/cotinine ratio (faster metabolizers) were ~50% less likely to be abstinent vs. smokers in the first quartile (slow metabolizers; 28% vs. 42%; OR=.54 [95% CI:.36–.82], p=.003). Among abstainers, plasma nicotine levels (assessed 1&nbsp;week after treatment began) decreased linearly across the 3-HC/cotinine ratio (\beta=-3.38, t[355]=-3.09, p&amp;amp;amp;lt;.05). These data support the value of the 3-HC/cotinine ratio as a biomarker to predict success with transdermal nicotine for smoking cessation.;,citation_author=Robert A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does the nicotine metabolite ratio moderate smoking cessation treatment outcomes in real-world settings? A prospective study;,citation_abstract=Background and aims In smoking treatment trials comparing varenicline with transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), stratified by nicotine metabolite (3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) ratio (NMR), the relative benefit of varenicline is greater among normal rather than slow metabolizers. This study tested if the relative effectiveness of varenicline and NRT is associated with NMR status in a natural treatment setting. A secondary aim was to test if this relationship is moderated by behavioural support. Design Prospective observational multi-centre study with 4-week and 52-week follow-up. Setting Nine English Stop Smoking Services (SSS). Participants Data came from 1556 smokers (aged \geq 16 years) attending SSS between March 2012 and March 2013. Interventions Participants received pharmacotherapy together with behavioural support. Measurements The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence at both follow-up times. Main explanatory variables were (1) NMR status [slow (NMR &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.31, n = 451) versus normal (NMR \geq 0.31, n = 1105) metabolizers]; (2) pharmacotherapy (varenicline versus NRT) and (3) behavioural support (individual versus group-based treatment). Analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic, SSS, mental/physical health and smoking characteristics. Findings Of participants, 44.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.7–46.6%] and 8.0% (95% CI = 6.8–9.5%) were continuously abstinent at 4 and 52 weeks. Varenicline was more effective than NRT at 4 weeks (P &amp;lt; 0.001) but only marginally so at 52 weeks (P = 0.061). There was no or inclusive evidence that NMR status moderated relative efficacy of varenicline and NRT at 4- [P = 0.60, Bayes factor (BF) = 0.25] or 52-week follow-ups (P = 0.74, BF = 0.73). However, this relationship was moderated by behavioural support (p = 0.012): the relative benefit of varenicline over NRT at 52-week follow-up was greater in slow, not normal, metabolizers receiving group rather than individual support (P = 0.012). Conclusions In a real-world setting, the nicotine metabolite ratio status of treatment-seeking smokers does not appear to contribute substantially to the differential effectiveness of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in Stop Smoking Services, when both pharmacotherapy and behavioural support are self-selected.;,citation_author=Lion Shahab;,citation_author=Linda Bauld;,citation_author=Ann McNeill;,citation_author=Rachel F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Use of the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio as a Biomarker to Personalize Smoking Cessation Treatment: Current Evidence and Future Directions;,citation_abstract=The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a genetically informed biomarker of rate of nicotine metabolism, has been validated as a tool to select the optimal treatment for individual smokers, thereby improving treatment outcomes. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the development of the NMR as a biomarker of individual differences in nicotine metabolism, the relationship between the NMR and smoking behavior, the clinical utility of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation, and the potential mechanisms that underlie the relationship between NMR and smoking cessation. We conclude with a call for additional research necessary to determine the ultimate benefits of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation. These future directions include measurement and other methodologic considerations, disseminating this approach to at-risk subpopulations, expanding the NMR to evaluate its efficacy in predicting treatment responses to e-cigarettes and other noncigarette forms of nicotine, and implementation science including cost-effectiveness analyses.See all articles in this Special Collection Honoring Paul F.

The current review aimed to: (i) estimate smoking prevalence in homeless populations; (ii) explore the efficacy of smoking cessation and smoking reduction interventions for homeless individuals; and (iii) describe the barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation and smoking reduction.MethodSystematic review of peer-reviewed research. Data sources included electronic academic databases. Search terms: “smoking” AND “homeless” AND “tobacco”, including adult (18+ years) smokers accessing homeless support services.ResultsFifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 46 USA). Data could not be meta-analysed due to large methodological inconsistencies and the lack of randomised controlled trials. Smoking prevalence ranged from 57% to 82%. Although there was no clear evidence on which cessation methods work best, layered approaches with additions to usual care seemed to offer modest enhancements in quit rates. Key barriers to cessation exist around the priority of smoking, beliefs around negative impact on mental health and substance use, and environmental influences.ConclusionsHomeless smokers will benefit from layered interventions which support many of their competing needs. To best understand what works, future recommendations include the need for consensus on the reporting of cessation outcomes.;,citation_author=Kirstie Soar;,citation_author=Lynne Dawkins;,citation_author=Deborah Robson;,citation_author=Sharon Cox;,citation_publication_date=2020-06;,citation_cover_date=2020-06;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1017/jsc.2020.11;,citation_issn=1834-2612;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Smoking Cessation;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine Learning of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Network Connectivity Predicts Substance Abuse Treatment Completion;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Successfully treating illicit drug use has become paramount, yet elusive. Devising specialized treatment interventions could increase positive outcomes, but it is necessary to identify risk factors of poor long-term outcomes to develop specialized, efficacious treatments. We investigated whether functional network connectivity (FNC) measures were predictive of substance abuse treatment completion using machine learning pattern classification of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. METHODS: Treatment-seeking stimulant- or heroin-dependent incarcerated participants (n&nbsp;= 139; 89 women) volunteered for a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. Participants performed a response inhibition Go/NoGo functional magnetic resonance imaging task prior to onset of the substance abuse treatment. We tested whether FNC related to the anterior cingulate cortex would be predictive of those who would or would not complete a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. RESULTS: Machine learning pattern classification models using FNC between networks incorporating the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula predicted which individuals would (sensitivity: 81.31%) or would not (specificity: 78.13%) complete substance abuse treatment. FNC analyses predicted treatment completion above and beyond other clinical assessment measures, including age, sex, IQ, years of substance use, psychopathy, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and motivation for change. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant neural network connections predicted substance abuse treatment outcomes, which could illuminate new targets for developing interventions designed to reduce or eliminate substance use while facilitating long-term outcomes. This work represents the first application of machine-learning models of FNC analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to predict which substance abusers would or would not complete treatment.;,citation_author=Vaughn R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalizing substance use treatment based on pre-treatment impulsivity and sensation seeking: A review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Theoretically, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment that matches an individual’s etiology and/or maintaining factors should be more effective than a treatment that does not directly address these factors. Impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking may contribute to the development and maintenance of SUDs, and are potential candidate variables for assigning patients to treatment. The goal is to identify whether current research can provide insight into which treatments may be most effective for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking, relative to other treatments. A secondary goal is to provide recommendations for personalizing SUD treatment based on etiology or maintaining factors. METHOD: This review summarizes clinical trials that speak to the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use disorders, based on pre-treatment impulsivity, sensation seeking, or related constructs. RESULTS: Few studies examine the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking. Very preliminary evidence suggests that contingency management may hold promise for individuals high in impulsivity. Pharmacological trials were under-represented in the current review, despite evidence that the effectiveness of some pharmacological interventions may be moderated by impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Potential reasons for slow rate of progress to date are provided. Given slow accumulation of evidence, an alternative method for personalizing treatment based on pre-treatment psychosocial factors, including impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking, is proposed. Future research may explore the role of contingency management for SUD among individuals with high pre-treatment impulsivity or sensation seeking.

The study comprised 126 smokers (50%) of 252 failures, from a double-blind smoking cessation trial with nicotine patch, who accepted recycling after 1 year. Subjects were allocated nicotine patches delivering 15, 20 or 25 mg of nicotine (over 16 hours) according to their base-line saliva cotinine concentrations in an open trial. The treatment period was 12 weeks followed by tapering over 6 weeks. The percentage of quitters after 3, 12, 26, and 52 weeks was 44, 20, 7 and 6%, respectively. After 26 weeks, all subjects had relapsed in the group previously treated with active nicotine patch compared with 12% abstainers in the previous placebo subjects. The sustained abstinence rate without slips after one year was 2%.

The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance use through its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences between adolescents from two-parent families and those from single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized prediction of antidepressant v. Placebo response: Evidence from the EMBARC study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, it is possible that only certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to antidepressants. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anhedonia, and cognitive control deficits. METHODS: Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Five pre-treatment variables moderated treatment response. Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations of a 10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31% of the sample would exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with sertraline relative to placebo. Although there were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can be identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model must be tested prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment selection.

Tracking Trends Over Time for Youth Anxiety, Depression, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Conduct Problems;,citation_abstract=With the development of empirically supported treatments over the decades, have youth psychotherapies grown stronger? To investigate, we examined changes over time in treatment effects for four frequently treated youth mental-health problems: anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct disorders. We used PubMed and PsycINFO to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published between January 1960 and May 2017 involving youths between the ages of 4 and 18 years. We also searched reviews and meta-analyses of youth psychotherapy research, followed reference trails in the reports we identified, and obtained additional studies identified by therapy researchers whom we contacted. We identified 453 RCTs (31,933 participants) spanning 53 years (1963-2016). Effect sizes for the problem-relevant outcome measures were synthesized via multilevel meta-analysis. We tracked temporal trends for each problem domain and then examined multiple study characteristics that might moderate those trends. Mean effect size increased nonsignificantly for anxiety, decreased nonsignificantly for ADHD, and decreased significantly for depression and conduct problems. Moderator analyses involving multiple study subgroups showed only a few exceptions to these surprising patterns. The findings suggest that new approaches to treatment design and intervention science may be needed, especially for depression and conduct problems. We suggest intensifying the search for mechanisms of change, making treatments more transdiagnostic and personalizable, embedding treatments within youth ecosystems, adapting treatments to the social and technological changes that alter youth dysfunction and treatment needs, and resisting old habits that can make treatments unduly skeuomorphic.;,citation_author=John R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Research review: Polygenic methods and their application to psychiatric traits;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the last 5 years. METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing heritability. FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic risk factors.;,citation_author=Naomi R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Sarah June Kittleson Sant’Ana;,citation_author=Gaylen Fronk;,citation_author=John J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Idiographic Examination of Day-to-Day Patterns of Substance Use Craving, Negative Affect, and Tobacco Use Among Young Adults in Recovery;,citation_abstract=Psychological constructs, such as negative affect and substance use cravings that closely predict relapse, show substantial intra-individual day-to-day variability. This intra-individual variability of relevant psychological states combined with the “one day of a time” nature of sustained abstinence warrant a day-to-day investigation of substance use recovery. This study examines day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use among 30 college students in 12-step recovery from drug and alcohol addictions. To account for individual variability in day-to-day process, it applies an idiographic approach. The sample of 20 males and 10 females (mean age = 21) was drawn from members of a collegiate recovery community at a large university. Data were collected with end-of-day data collections taking place over an average of 26.7 days. First-order vector autoregression models were fit to each individual predicting daily levels of substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use from the same three variables one day prior. Individual model results demonstrated substantial inter-individual differences in intra-individual recovery process. Based on estimates from individual models, cluster analyses were used to group individuals into two homogeneous subgroups. Group comparisons demonstrate distinct patterns in the day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use, suggesting the importance of idiographic approaches to recovery management and that the potential value of focusing on negative affect or tobacco use as prevention targets depends on idiosyncratic processes.;,citation_author=Yao Zheng;,citation_author=Richard P.

<p>Precision mental health is the application of the precision medicine paradigm to mental health conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019 inselNIMHResearchDomain2014 bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-inselNIMHResearchDomain2014" role="doc-biblioref">Insel 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman, Lyon, and Wolpert 2016</a>)</span>. Precision medicine and precision mental health aim to address an important problem in traditional treatment selection: what works best at a population level does not necessarily work best for a given patient. For example, although treatment A may be more effective than treatment B across the population, it may be that treatment B is markedly more effective for a specific patient.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on population-level efficacy, precision mental health seeks to guide treatment selection using individual difference characteristics that are likely to predict treatment success for each patient <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020">(<a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>)</span>. Successful precision mental health would increase the likelihood of treatment success for each patient because each patient receives the treatment predicted to work best for them. It would also improve treatment effectiveness rates across the population because each treatment is administered only to the patients for whom that treatment is expected to be their best option <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016 bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020">(<a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman, Lyon, and Wolpert 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to offering improved effectiveness, precision mental health approaches may be more resource-efficient. Clinical trials to develop and validate new treatments are expensive, resource-intensive, and slow. These costs may also produce a treatment that is no better than existing treatments (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="weiszArePsychotherapiesYoung2019">(<a href="#ref-weiszArePsychotherapiesYoung2019" role="doc-biblioref">Weisz et al. 2019</a>)</span>), or potentially ineffective altogether. In contrast, by seeking to optimize existing treatments and direct them to the <em>right</em> patients, precision mental health stands as a cost-effective alternative poised for more immediate impact to patients.</p>
<p>Researchers have pursued precision mental health – and precision medicine broadly – for decades. In medicine, emphasis on personalizing treatments has been tied closely to genetic factors and thus has grown rapidly with the ascendancy of advanced genetic methods such as genome-wide association studies, polygenic scores, and functional annotation <span class="citation" data-cites="wrayResearchReviewPolygenic2014 bogdanPolygenicRiskScores2018 kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017 huLeveragingFunctionalAnnotations2017 finucanePartitioningHeritabilityFunctional2015">(<a href="#ref-wrayResearchReviewPolygenic2014" role="doc-biblioref">Wray et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-bogdanPolygenicRiskScores2018" role="doc-biblioref">Bogdan, Baranger, and Agrawal 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Kranzler et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-huLeveragingFunctionalAnnotations2017" role="doc-biblioref">Hu et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-finucanePartitioningHeritabilityFunctional2015" role="doc-biblioref">Finucane et al. 2015</a>)</span>. Meaningful progress towards precision treatments has been made in the cancer domain; for example, some chemotherapy drugs that are not effective at a population level have been shown to help individuals with specific non-small-cell lung carcinoma tumor mutations <span class="citation" data-cites="rosellErlotinibStandardChemotherapy2012">(<a href="#ref-rosellErlotinibStandardChemotherapy2012" role="doc-biblioref">Rosell et al. 2012</a>)</span>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these advances have been propelled by significant funding - cancer research has received far and away the most NIH funding over the past 25 years <span class="citation" data-cites="kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017">(<a href="#ref-kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Kranzler et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Within precision mental health, an early research example comes from the substance use disorder (SUD) domain: the Project MATCH Research Group attempted to match people with alcohol use disorder to a particular treatment based on individual differences such as gender, social support, or symptom severity <span class="citation" data-cites="projectmatchresearchgroupProjectMATCHMatching1993 projectmatchresearchgroupMatchingAlcoholismTreatments1998">(<a href="#ref-projectmatchresearchgroupProjectMATCHMatching1993" role="doc-biblioref">Project Match Research Group 1993</a>, <a href="#ref-projectmatchresearchgroupMatchingAlcoholismTreatments1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. Many researchers have followed in their footsteps as the understanding has grown that neither mental health diagnoses nor treatments are one-size-fits-all <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>)</span>. This research has primarily focused on selecting among treatments for depression (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisPersonalizedAdvantageIndex2014 webbPersonalizedPredictionAntidepressant2019">(<a href="#ref-derubeisPersonalizedAdvantageIndex2014" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-webbPersonalizedPredictionAntidepressant2019" role="doc-biblioref">Webb et al. 2019</a>)</span>; for review, see <span class="citation" data-cites="cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018">(<a href="#ref-cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen and DeRubeis 2018</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Despite these opportunities for advances, however, precision mental health research has progressed with limited success <span class="citation" data-cites="kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021">(<a href="#ref-kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kessler and Luedtke 2021</a>)</span>. Efforts thus far have often focused on tailoring treatments at the group level; in other words, identifying a (single) factor that divides individuals within a diagnostic category into subgroups that can be treated differently <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>)</span>. However, extant research has not yet enabled reliable recommendations for treatment selection even at the group level - let alone for an individual patient. These patient-level predictions are required for clinical implementation; our goal in clinical science is to predict behavior such that we can apply findings to a new patient.</p>
<p>One reason for this slow progress is that many factors influence a complex clinical phenomenon like treatment success. Thus, any single feature (i.e., predictor variable) cannot account for more than a small portion of the variance in treatment success <span class="citation" data-cites="kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021 inselNIMHResearchDomain2014">(<a href="#ref-kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kessler and Luedtke 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-inselNIMHResearchDomain2014" role="doc-biblioref">Insel 2014</a>)</span>. This idea is comparable to the shift in understanding within genetics: research has moved away from candidate gene studies to polygenic approaches that rely on small contributions from many genes <span class="citation" data-cites="bogdanPolygenicRiskScores2018 chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018 wrayResearchReviewPolygenic2014">(<a href="#ref-bogdanPolygenicRiskScores2018" role="doc-biblioref">Bogdan, Baranger, and Agrawal 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chen, Horton, and Bierut 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wrayResearchReviewPolygenic2014" role="doc-biblioref">Wray et al. 2014</a>)</span>. Unfortunately, traditional analytic techniques have often limited the ability to consider more than one or a few features simultaneously. These limitations have also prevented considering concurrently features across constructs (e.g., demographics, psychological traits, environmental variables; <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020">(<a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>)</span>). Therefore, models have failed to capture the real-world complexity underlying these clinical phenomena.</p>
<p>Moreover, because researchers using traditional analytic techniques typically develop and evaluate their precision mental health models in a single sample, the models may become very overfit to that sample <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>. Consequently, they do not generalize well to new patients that were not used for model development. This problem is particularly concerning because clinical implementation of precision mental health requires that these models provide accurate recommendations about treatment selection for <em>new</em> patients rather than explaining treatment success within the study sample.</p>
<p>These pitfalls interact with each other. To capture sufficient complexity to predict treatment success, we need to increase the total number of features in precision mental health models. Incorporating more features, however, makes overfitting the data more likely. Thus, successful precision mental health requires an analytic approach that can handle high-dimensional data without becoming too overfit to generalize to new patients.</p>

Machine learning is an alternative analytic technique that uses statistical algorithms trained on high-dimensional arrays (hundreds or even thousands) of features <span class="citation" data-cites="jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013 kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018 ngMachineLearningYearning2018">(<a href="#ref-jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013" role="doc-biblioref">James et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-ngMachineLearningYearning2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ng 2018</a>)</span>. Flexibly considering many features simultaneously means these models can tap the tangled web of constructs that comprise complex clinical phenomena. Critically, this allows researchers to consider many features in the same model – unlike previous precision mental health research that was limited to considering very few features simultaneously <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>)</span>. This high dimensionality across and within sets of related features is necessary to explain a high portion of variance in person-level treatment success.</p>
<p>Although machine learning models can handle very large numbers of features, this capacity comes at a cost, referred to as the “bias-variance trade-off” <span class="citation" data-cites="jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013 ngMachineLearningYearning2018">(<a href="#ref-jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013" role="doc-biblioref">James et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-ngMachineLearningYearning2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ng 2018</a>)</span>. Too many features (particularly correlated features) yield unstable models that vary strongly based on the data used to develop them. High variance compromises model generalizability because a high variance (e.g., very flexible) model may not predict very accurately in new data. However, too few features (as well as other constraints on model characteristics) yield biased models that also do not predict well because they miss important predictive patterns and relationships. Machine learning uses various techniques (e.g., regularization, hyperparameter tuning, simultaneous consideration of many model configurations) to optimize this bias-variance trade-off to accommodate high-dimensional sets of features while reducing overfitting <span class="citation" data-cites="jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013 kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018 ngMachineLearningYearning2018 mooneyBigDataPublic2018">(<a href="#ref-jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013" role="doc-biblioref">James et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-ngMachineLearningYearning2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ng 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-mooneyBigDataPublic2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mooney and Pejaver 2018</a>)</span>. Thus, machine learning methods may allow us to build precision mental health models that both capture clinical complexity and generalize accurately to new data.</p>
<p>Finally, machine learning provides rigorous resampling techniques to fit and evaluate models in separate data <span class="citation" data-cites="jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013">(<a href="#ref-jamesIntroductionStatisticalLearning2013" role="doc-biblioref">James et al. 2013</a>)</span>. Consequently, models generalize well to new patients because they are evaluated on out-of-sample prediction. In a simplest case, data can be divided into held-in and held-out samples. More sophisticated resampling techniques such as cross-validation involve dividing the data many times to create multiple held-in and held-out samples <span class="citation" data-cites="krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014 jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Krstajic et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>. These approaches offer significant advantages for 1) accurately selecting a best model among multiple model configurations, and 2) estimating how well that model will perform when applied to new data (e.g., new patients in a clinical setting). Applying machine learning can accomplish the goal in precision mental health of accurate, robust treatment selection for new patients.</p>

<p>Critically, the combination of machine learning methods with the precision mental health paradigm may be able to mitigate health disparities in our current treatment pipeline <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>)</span>. Treatments are rarely designed or evaluated in diverse samples; input directly from patient shareholders is incorporated even less often. Although the NIH has launched some new initiatives to improve effort in these areas, when it comes to treatments, we still rely almost exclusively on treatments developed decades ago that were effective in homogeneous samples. Unfortunately, the people who we failed to include in our treatment design and validation are also those who are often disproportionately affected by these exact health conditions or face additional barriers to receive effective treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="moralesCallActionAddress2020 barksdaleInnovativeDirectionsAdvance2022 officeofthesurgeongeneralusMentalHealthCulture2001 jacobsonDigitalTherapeuticsMental2022">(<a href="#ref-moralesCallActionAddress2020" role="doc-biblioref">Morales, Barksdale, and Beckel-Mitchener 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-barksdaleInnovativeDirectionsAdvance2022" role="doc-biblioref">Barksdale, Pérez-Stable, and Gordon 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-officeofthesurgeongeneralusMentalHealthCulture2001" role="doc-biblioref">Office of the Surgeon General (US), Center for Mental Health, and (US) 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobsonDigitalTherapeuticsMental2022" role="doc-biblioref">Jacobson, Kowatsch, and Marsch 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In some ways, these problems have been amplified by early work in precision medicine and precision mental health. Studies often begin with retrospective samples before bringing the models built in those samples to new patients. Thus, these models may be likely to fail for the same people for whom our initial treatments fail - the model can only be as good as the data with which it was developed <span class="citation" data-cites="aldridgeResearchTrainingRecommendations2019">(<a href="#ref-aldridgeResearchTrainingRecommendations2019" role="doc-biblioref">Aldridge 2019</a>)</span>. However, when this research is done thoughtfully, there are clear opportunities to address health disparities.</p>
<p>First, we can make a concerted effort to build treatment selection models using data from previously completed trials where there was good representation across as many marginalized characteristics as possible. This may include demographic variables such as sex, gender identity, race, or ethnicity, among others. Other important characteristics to consider include income, access to insurance, and geographic region.</p>
<p>In some contexts, it would be problematic to use predictors that tap into constructs delineating marginalized identities such as race or socioeconomic status. For example, making decisions about who gets insurance (or doesn’t) and who gets released earlier from prison (or doesn’t) based on race would be discriminatory (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="farayolaEthicsTrustworthinessAI2023">(<a href="#ref-farayolaEthicsTrustworthinessAI2023" role="doc-biblioref">Farayola et al. 2023</a>)</span>). However, in the precision mental health landscape, we are not deciding <em>who</em> gets treatment. Rather, we are deciding <em>which</em> treatment to give a specific patient. Thus, we can take advantage of experiential or symptomatological differences as a result of characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, income, or comorbid health conditions to improve treatment outcomes across vulnerable subpopulations.</p>
<p>An additional way in which this approach can help mitigate health disparities is through access. Access to treatment is a known barrier in mental healthcare and a contributing factor driving mental healthcare disparities <span class="citation" data-cites="jacobsonDigitalTherapeuticsMental2022">(<a href="#ref-jacobsonDigitalTherapeuticsMental2022" role="doc-biblioref">Jacobson, Kowatsch, and Marsch 2022</a>)</span>. Many individual difference features that could help build treatment selection models may be easily measured via self-report, and dimensionality reduction approaches employed within machine learning can limit the number of features that need to be assessed. Consequently, treatment selection models might require sparse assessment of only a handful of readily available items and could even be implemented online. In cases where treatments are available over-the-counter, completing the assessment remotely means that individuals without insurance or access to in-person medical care can still give themselves the best chance of treatment success.</p>

<p>For those who do get treatment, the best available smoking cessation treatments are modestly effective. The medications varenicline and combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT) are consistently identified as the most effective options when combined with psychosocial counseling <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013 schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013 bakerSmokingTreatmentReport2021 rigottiTreatmentTobaccoSmoking2022">(<a href="#ref-cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Schlam and Baker 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-bakerSmokingTreatmentReport2021" role="doc-biblioref">Baker and McCarthy 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-rigottiTreatmentTobaccoSmoking2022" role="doc-biblioref">Rigotti et al. 2022</a>)</span>.

These medications appear to be equally (though modestly) effective: a meta-analysis demonstrated comparable effectiveness rates <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013">(<a href="#ref-cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2013</a>)</span>, and the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) directly comparing varenicline and C-NRT did not find a difference between them <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

These rates represent a best-case scenario in that clinical trial data involve treatment regimens that are rigorously followed and optimized for adherence. Additionally, because several first-line (i.e., FDA-approved) smoking cessation treatments have comparable population-level effectiveness rates, population effectiveness alone cannot guide selection among smoking cessation treatments. These facts suggest a critical need for machine learning-assisted treatment selection in the cigarette smoking domain.</p>
</section>
<section id="opportunities-for-differential-treatment-selection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opportunities-for-differential-treatment-selection">Opportunities for differential treatment selection</h4>
<p>National clinical guidelines note that “there are no well-accepted algorithms to guide optimal selection” between any of the first-line medications (<span class="citation" data-cites="fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008">(<a href="#ref-fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fiore et al. 2008</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;44). However, there may be reason to expect that some treatments may work better than others for a specific individual.</p>
<p>First, there is enormous heterogeneity among people who smoke cigarettes. Individuals may differ with respect to the etiology of their tobacco use disorder, the severity of their dependence and/or withdrawal symptoms, historical factors related to their tobacco use (e.g., age of first use, years smoking, number of previous quit attempts), and barriers to initiation and/or retention in smoking cessation treatments <span class="citation" data-cites="oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017 wangSociodemographicVariabilityAdolescent2009 zhengIdiographicExaminationDaytoDay2013">(<a href="#ref-oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017" role="doc-biblioref">Oliver and McClernon 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-wangSociodemographicVariabilityAdolescent2009" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-zhengIdiographicExaminationDaytoDay2013" role="doc-biblioref">Zheng et al. 2013</a>)</span>. These factors that affect the development and course of their disorder could include demographic traits, personal medical history, and many other key individual difference characteristics. However, this heterogeneity is typically neglected when selecting among available treatments.</p>
<p>Second, smoking cessation medications have distinct pharmacological mechanisms of action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which may affect how helpful they are for different people. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides nicotine, a full agonist at nAChRs. Different NRTs provide nicotine differently. C-NRT consists of a nicotine patch and ad libitum nicotine lozenge use. The patch offers transdermal administration of a low, steady dose of nicotine. Some people who smoke cigarettes may rely on this low, steady nicotine level to replace nicotine from cigarettes. Lozenges provide oral administration of nicotine with more rapid onset, which could help individuals who need a quick boost during craving.</p>
<p>Other individuals who smoke may benefit from a medication like varenicline. In contrast to NRTs, varenicline is a partial agonist at nAChRs <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillNicotineReceptorPartial2016">(<a href="#ref-cahillNicotineReceptorPartial2016" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Partial agonists have a pharmacological action that is somewhere between full agonists and antagonists, depending on the level of surrounding neurotransmitter. In the absence of a full agonist or endogenous neurotransmitter, partial agonists can act as a functional agonist with lower activity than a full agonist. In the presence of a full agonist (e.g., a cigarette) or endogenous neurotransmitter, however, they act as functional antagonists because their binding to the receptor limits the amount of binding from the full agonist and consequently reduces that response <span class="citation" data-cites="jordanDiscoveryDevelopmentVarenicline2018 liebermanDopaminePartialAgonists2004">(<a href="#ref-jordanDiscoveryDevelopmentVarenicline2018" role="doc-biblioref">Jordan and Xi 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-liebermanDopaminePartialAgonists2004" role="doc-biblioref">Lieberman 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, varenicline may be more pharmacologically flexible than NRT medications: when an individual is not smoking, it can produce milder, nicotine-like effects; if an individual begins smoking again, it could block or reduce full agonist (cigarette nicotine) activity at the receptor. This would be expected to reduce the pharmacological effect of nicotine, likely reducing the behavioral pleasure of smoking <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillNicotineReceptorPartial2016">(<a href="#ref-cahillNicotineReceptorPartial2016" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Although C-NRT has some behavioral flexibility built in (i.e., combination of slow, steady dosing with faster-acting lozenges that can be used in response to internal states or environmental cues), it acts exclusively as a full agonist at nAChRs and cannot exert antagonist-like actions.</p>
<p>Third, features across several behavioral or environmental domains may also guide treatment selection, alone or in combination with medication mechanisms of action. For example, some cigarette smokers may have strong cravings with good self-monitoring. These characteristics may make treatments such as nicotine lozenges or gum more effective because they are aware enough of their own craving to get a quick “hit” of nicotine when needed. In contrast, although C-NRT is largely more effective than single NRT (e.g., nicotine patch alone) <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013">(<a href="#ref-cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2013</a>)</span>, there may be individuals for whom a multi-component treatment is overwhelming, thus reducing adherence and ultimate effectiveness. Some smokers may be prone to side effects from a specific treatment, reducing adherence and subsequent likelihood of treatment success, though they may not have had the same adverse reactions to a different treatment. Environmentally, an individual who lives with other smokers may benefit from a partial agonist treatment like varenicline because any secondhand smoke would produce less effect. Any of these characteristics, among others, could powerfully inform treatment selection for cigarette smoking cessation.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the potential clinical benefit of using a precision mental health paradigm to inform treatment selection for smoking cessation. They also point to the value of analytic techniques that can incorporate complex interactions among features. Although these examples were selected because they are more intuitive, there are likely other unexpected ways that treatment success differs across people. Machine learning models are not limited to intuitive or theoretically derived features. Thus, machine learning may reveal unanticipated features that could meaningfully guide treatment selection for cigarette smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Finally, there is some evidence that individuals respond differently to different treatments. One large study that examined multiple medication-assisted quit attempts found that individuals who switched medications were more likely to quit than individuals who used the same medication again or who did not use a medication on the first quit attempt but added one at the second <span class="citation" data-cites="heckmanEffectivenessSwitchingSmokingCessation2017">(<a href="#ref-heckmanEffectivenessSwitchingSmokingCessation2017" role="doc-biblioref">Heckman et al. 2017</a>)</span>. Relatedly, there is some evidence that re-treatment with the same medication as a previous, unsuccessful quit attempt is not effective <span class="citation" data-cites="fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008 tonnesenRecyclingNicotinePatches1993">(<a href="#ref-fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fiore et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-tonnesenRecyclingNicotinePatches1993" role="doc-biblioref">Tønnesen et al. 1993</a>)</span> Indeed, Gonzales and colleagues found that “abstinence rates are more than threefold lower for NRTs and twofold lower for bupropion” during re-treatment compared to initial treatment using the same medication (<span class="citation" data-cites="gonzalesRetreatmentVareniclineSmoking2014">(<a href="#ref-gonzalesRetreatmentVareniclineSmoking2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gonzales et al. 2014</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;391).

<p>Related research in this area seeks to understand who will succeed using a single treatment. Massago and colleagues (2024) examined medical records of individuals completing cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and built a machine learning model to predict who is most likely to quit smoking using CBT. They note that this model “can be used to establish priorities when the demand is higher than the capacity” (<span class="citation" data-cites="massagoApplicabilityMachineLearning2024">(<a href="#ref-massagoApplicabilityMachineLearning2024" role="doc-biblioref">Massago et al. 2024</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;10). Other research has used tree-based machine learning models to show that delay discounting tasks can differentiate individuals who respond to group CBT from individuals who do not <span class="citation" data-cites="coughlinMachineLearningApproachPredicting2020a">(<a href="#ref-coughlinMachineLearningApproachPredicting2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Coughlin et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This research investigating prognostic factors is critical for understanding mechanisms that underlie smoking cessation success. Progress in this area may allow us to identify processes that improve the likelihood of quitting successfully, and we may be able to intervene in some of these processes prior to a quit attempt or improve design of preventative interventions. For example, individuals are less likely to succeed in a quit attempt when cigarettes are available and when confidence is low <span class="citation" data-cites="bickelPredictorsSmokingCessation2023">(<a href="#ref-bickelPredictorsSmokingCessation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Bickel et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Unsurprisingly, key steps in pre-cessation and cessation counseling include getting rid of cigarettes and increasing confidence to quit. As more prognostic factors are identified, we can improve overall treatment effectiveness by targeting key predictors of success.</p>
<p>Although models that identify prognostic factors are important, they do not offer an actionable way forward to select among treatment options. Even research that informs us as to who might succeed within a specific treatment has limited utility for treatment selection: what do we do for a patient who is predicted not to succeed using that treatment? If different single-treatment prognostic models offer conflicting recommendations, how should a clinician or patient proceed? To <em>select among</em> treatments, we need “prescriptive” predictors <span class="citation" data-cites="cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018">(<a href="#ref-cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen and DeRubeis 2018</a>)</span>, or predictors that determine which treatment to prescribe. This type of predictor is what allows us to select the best treatment for a given patient.</p>
<p>Some research has begun to investigate factors that can allow selection among treatment options, particularly genetic factors and biomarkers (for review, see <span class="citation" data-cites="chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018">(<a href="#ref-chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chen, Horton, and Bierut 2018</a>)</span>). Chen and colleagues found that variants in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit (CHRNA5) predict differential treatment success among Black individuals who smoke: C-NRT was more effective for people with certain genotypes, whereas varenicline was more effective for people with other genotypes <span class="citation" data-cites="chenGeneticVariantCHRNA52020">(<a href="#ref-chenGeneticVariantCHRNA52020" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Many researchers have investigated the role of the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a phenotypic biomarker for nicotine metabolism that is easier to test than genotypes. Overall, it appears that slow metabolizers report greater cessation success with NRT medications, whereas varenicline is more effective for fast metabolizers <span class="citation" data-cites="shahabDoesNicotineMetabolite2019 schnollNicotineMetabolicRate2009 glatardAssociationNicotineMetabolism2017 chenowethNicotineMetaboliteRatio2016 lermanUseNicotineMetabolite2015">(<a href="#ref-shahabDoesNicotineMetabolite2019" role="doc-biblioref">Shahab et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-schnollNicotineMetabolicRate2009" role="doc-biblioref">Schnoll et al. 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-glatardAssociationNicotineMetabolism2017" role="doc-biblioref">Glatard et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-chenowethNicotineMetaboliteRatio2016" role="doc-biblioref">Chenoweth et al. 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-lermanUseNicotineMetabolite2015" role="doc-biblioref">Lerman et al. 2015</a>)</span>, though a review by Siegel and colleagues notes that “real-world evaluations of NMR to personalize treatment for smoking cessation have produced mixed findings so far” (<span class="citation" data-cites="siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020">(<a href="#ref-siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020" role="doc-biblioref">Siegel et al. 2020</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;265).</p>
<p>This research has exciting implications for selecting among treatments. However, using biologic and genetic factors comes with downsides when considering implementation. Though the necessary technology is improving, the testing required to collect these data is neither widely available nor accessible <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>)</span>. Moreover, using these data to select treatments is likely to exacerbate rather than mitigate existing disparities in mental healthcare. Using genetic and biological factors is likely to favor privileged individuals who have insurance that covers specialized care and specialty testing. Some have noted that biomarker testing for NMR is more affordable than genetic testing; however, there remain methodological challenges associated with establishing cut-off points for slow vs.&nbsp;fast metabolizers, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations for whom there are no NMR data available yet who experience greater smoking rates or associated risks (e.g., Native American/American Indian people, pregnant women, people who drink heavily or have other substance use disorders, people with serious mental illness, and individuals who identify as LGBTQ; <span class="citation" data-cites="siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020">(<a href="#ref-siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020" role="doc-biblioref">Siegel et al. 2020</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Other research has investigated non-biological factors as potential moderators of treatment effectiveness. Kaye and colleagues (2020) examined whether varenicline might be more effective than C-NRT among individuals who smoke and binge drink; however, varenicline’s effects did not vary as a function of drinking status <span class="citation" data-cites="kayeSearchingPersonalizedMedicine2020a">(<a href="#ref-kayeSearchingPersonalizedMedicine2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Kaye et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Piper and colleagues conducted a series of studies with the goal of advancing precision mental health for smoking cessation. They used a factorial design to identify ideal treatment combinations at the group level (e.g., pre-quit medication, pre-quit counseling, counseling modality, cessation medications; <span class="citation" data-cites="piperIdentifyingEffectiveIntervention2016">(<a href="#ref-piperIdentifyingEffectiveIntervention2016" role="doc-biblioref">Piper et al. 2016</a>)</span>). They followed up by exploring moderators of intervention main effects and interactions and found that psychiatric history moderated some treatment effects <span class="citation" data-cites="piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017a">(<a href="#ref-piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017a" role="doc-biblioref">Piper, Schlam, et al. 2017</a>)</span>. They also looked at whether various treatment components affected their purported treatment mechanisms to help elucidate how these treatments may be producing their effects <span class="citation" data-cites="piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017">(<a href="#ref-piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017" role="doc-biblioref">Piper, Cook, et al. 2017</a>)</span>. These studies took advantage of largely self-report data, making any resulting models more clinically implementable. However, each study examined only a single moderator or examined each moderator in a separate model. These analyses were ideally suited for clearly identifying moderators and explaining mechanisms, but they were less well-suited for finding high-dimensional sets of features that can predict differential treatment responses.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to produce a model that can serve as a decision-making tool to select among medication treatments for smoking cessation. We used machine learning analytic techniques to build a model that can take advantage of many features simultaneously while maintaining generalizability to new patients. We incorporated easy-to-collect self-report data as our primary model inputs such that any resulting model will be poised for accessible, equitable clinical implementation.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this project we built a machine learning model to predict treatment success 4 weeks post-quit for people who smoke who received one of three cigarette smoking cessation treatments from a previously completed comparative effectiveness trial <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>. This model was used to calculate probabilities of treatment success for each treatment to guide selection of the best treatment for any specific individual. We evaluated the clinical benefit of our model in these retrospective data while using resampling approaches that ensure our model offers benefit for treatment selection for new patients.</p>

<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>The data for this project came from a completed randomized controlled trial conducted by the University of Wisconsin (UW) Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (CTRI) <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>. This trial compared the effectiveness of three cigarette smoking cessation treatments (varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy [C-NRT], and nicotine patch). Briefly, 1086 daily cigarette smokers were enrolled in Madison, WI, USA and Milwaukee, WI, USA. Exclusion criteria included contraindicated medical (e.g., severe hypertension) or psychiatric conditions (e.g., severe and persistent mental illness), current use of contraindicated medications, and pregnancy or unwillingness to use appropriate methods of contraception while taking a study medication. Participants set a quit date with study staff and were enrolled for several weeks prior to the target quit date through at least 6 months following quitting smoking.</p>

<p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of medication treatment plus 6 sessions of motivational and skill-training counseling per clinical guidelines <span class="citation" data-cites="fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008">(<a href="#ref-fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fiore et al. 2008</a>)</span>. For varenicline, participants began medication use prior to their quit attempt, starting with 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days, followed by 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days, and 1 mg twice daily for 3 days. They continued use of 1 mg twice daily for 11 weeks following their quit date except in response to adverse effects. For C-NRT or nicotine patch, participants began using the patch on their quit date, starting with 21 mg for 8 weeks, followed by 14 mg for 2 weeks, and 7 mg for 2 weeks. All individuals who received C-NRT were also instructed to use 5 lozenges per day (2 or 4 mg nicotine lozenges determined by time to first daily cigarette) for the full 12 weeks except in the case of adverse effects.</p>

<p>Throughout study participation, participants were assessed for biologically confirmed, 7-day point-prevalence abstinence. Participants self-reported whether they had smoked over the past 7 days, and their report was biologically confirmed via exhaled carbon monoxide (CO).

<p>Our <em>primary prediction outcome</em> for our models was point-prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit. Later assessments of point-prevalence abstinence (12 weeks [end-of-treatment], 6 months) were used for clinical benefit analyses (see below) and supplemental analyses.</p>

<section id="feature-engineering-and-dimensionality-reduction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering-and-dimensionality-reduction">Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction</h4>
<p>Feature engineering is the process of converting raw predictors into meaningful numeric and/or categorical representations (features) that improve model effectiveness <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnFeatureEngineeringSelection2019">(<a href="#ref-kuhnFeatureEngineeringSelection2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2019</a>)</span>. A sample feature engineering script (i.e., tidymodels recipe) containing all feature engineering steps is available on our OSF study page (<a href="https://osf.io/qad4n/">https://osf.io/qad4n/</a>). Our generic feature engineering steps included: 1) imputing missing data (median imputation for numeric features, mode imputation for nominal and ordinal features); and 2) removing zero-variance features. Medians/modes for missing data imputation and identification of zero variance features were derived from held-in (training) data and applied to held-out (validation and test) data (see Cross-validation section below).</p>
<p>We used a Yeo-Johnson transformation on all numeric variables to address distributional shape. Unordered categorical variables were dummy-coded. Ordered categorical variables (e.g., Likert scale items on self-report measures) could be ordinal scored (i.e., treated as numeric data) or dummy-coded. We also allowed treatment (dummy coded) to interact with all other features. Finally, all features were normalized as a requirement of the GLMNet algorithm.</p>
<p>Although machine learning methods can handle high-dimensional data, there is a cost to including a high ratio of features to observations (“<em>p</em> to <em>n</em> ratio”). Models were <em>p</em> &gt; <em>n</em> are possible with machine learning; however, models can become easily overfit and therefore not generalizable to new data. Thus, we used several dimensionality reduction approaches to reduce the number of features in my models. We used data-driven methods for dimensionality reduction including: removing highly correlated or near-zero variance features, and considering feature engineering approaches that reduced the number of overall features (e.g., ordinal scoring vs.&nbsp;dummy coding). The algorithm GLMNet also inherently conducts dimensionality reduction by penalizing model complexity such that features’ predictive value must outweigh the cost of including an additional parameter in the model.</p>
<p>We also used several non-data-driven approaches for dimensionality reduction. First, we used domain knowledge to reduce dimensionality by removing features that lacked face validity for predicting abstinence or overlapped conceptually with other features. Second, we removed variables that stood in contrast to the ultimate implementation goals (e.g., variables whose assessment required blood work or lab tests).</p>
</section>
<section id="model-training-and-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-training-and-evaluation">Model training and evaluation</h4>
<p>Our classification models predicted 4-week point-prevalence abstinence. We also built models predicting 26-week (6 month) point-prevalence abstinence for secondary analyses; all model fitting and evaluation procedures were identical.</p>
<section id="model-configurations" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configurations">Model configurations</h5>
<p>All model configurations used the statistical algorithm Elastic Net Logistic Regression (GLMNet). This algorithm aligns with our primary goal of building a treatment selection model in several ways. First, it allows for explicit inclusion of interaction terms (i.e., including interactions between treatment and all other variables). This permits capturing many interactions that each account for a small portion of variance; as discussed, this seems critical to capturing the complexity of clinical phenomena. Second, GLMNet performs a degree of dimensionality reduction because it penalizes model complexity; thus, a model using this algorithm may require assessing fewer features than are initially considered in the model. This characteristic aligns with our intention to implement this model in clinical practice, where highly burdensome assessments are impractical and thereby not feasible. Finally, linear models such as GLMNet are often more interpretable and transparent because they produce parameter estimates for the features in the model. Several recent reviews have noted interpretability as a potential barrier to using machine learning approaches for clinical and public health goals; consequently, we aimed to prioritize interpretability <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021 mooneyBigDataPublic2018 cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-mooneyBigDataPublic2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mooney and Pejaver 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen and DeRubeis 2018</a>)</span>. Initial testing showed that GLMNet outperformed or performed comparably to models fit using several other well-established statistical algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest). Thus, we had no reason not to prefer an algorithm that aligned well with our ultimate clinical goals.</p>
<p>Candidate model configurations differed across sensible values of the hyperparameters alpha and lambda (GLMNet tuning parameters). We also considered several outcome resampling techniques: no resampling, up-sampling, down-sampling, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). These resampling techniques were used to create majority/abstinence to minority/smoking ratios in the held-in training data ranging from 2:1 to 1:1 (natural rate in data ~3:1).</p>
<p>We considered several feature sets across model configurations. Feature sets could include either items (i.e., individual items within a self-report measure) or scales (i.e., total scale and sub-scale scores derived from items in a self-report measure). All other features (e.g., demographic variables) were included across model configurations.</p>
<p>Feature engineering steps also differed across model configurations regarding how ordinal data were scored. Specifically, ordinal data could be considered as numeric (e.g., 1 - 7) or dummy coded (e.g., 7 dummy code features for a 7-level variable). Numeric and unordered nominal data were treated identically across configurations.</p>
</section>
<section id="performance-metric" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-metric">Performance metric</h5>
<p>Our primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation was area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018 youngstromPrimerReceiverOperating2014">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-youngstromPrimerReceiverOperating2014" role="doc-biblioref">Youngstrom 2014</a>)</span>. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). This metric was selected because it 1) combines sensitivity and specificity, which are both important characteristics for clinical implementation; and 2) is unaffected by class imbalance, which is important for comparing models with differing levels of class imbalance.</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-validation" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-validation">Cross-validation</h5>
<p>Cross-validation allows for rigorous consideration of many model configurations (i.e., combinations of feature sets, statistical algorithms, resampling techniques, and hyperparameters) and prioritizes performance in new data not used for model training <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>. Specifically, we used nested cross-validation for model training, selection, and evaluation with auROC <span class="citation" data-cites="krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014">(<a href="#ref-krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Krstajic et al. 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Nested cross-validation uses two nested loops for dividing and holding out folds: an outer loop, where held-out folds serve as <em>test sets</em> for model evaluation; and inner loops, where held-out folds serve as <em>validation sets</em> for model selection. Importantly, these sets are independent, maintaining separation between data used to train the models, select the best models, and evaluate those best models. Therefore, nested cross-validation removes optimization bias from the evaluation of model performance in the test sets and can yield lower variance performance estimates than single test set approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000 krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Krstajic et al. 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We used 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loops and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop. Best model configurations were selected using median auROC across the 10 <em>validation sets</em>. Final performance evaluation of those best model configurations used median auROC across the 30 <em>test sets</em>. We report median auROC for our best model configurations in the test sets. For completeness, we also report auROCs from the validation sets in the Supplement. In addition, we report other key performance metrics for the best model configurations including sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) from the test sets <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following model evaluation, we completed another round of 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation using the full dataset. A single best model configuration was selected using median auROC across the 10 held-out folds. Importantly, model performance in this phase is used <em>only</em> for selection and not evaluation <span class="citation" data-cites="krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014">(<a href="#ref-krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Krstajic et al. 2014</a>)</span>.

<p>We used a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian confidence intervals (CIs) for auROC for the best models. Posterior probability is the likelihood of obtaining our results given our data. A posterior probability distribution around a given parameter (e.g., median auROC) allows us to assess the certainty of our results.</p>
<p>To estimate the probability of different performance across models, we regressed the auROCs (logit transformed) from the 30 test sets as a function of model outcome (4-week model vs.&nbsp;26-week model). Following recommendations from the tidymodels team <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022">(<a href="#ref-kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn 2022</a>)</span>, we set two random intercepts: one for the repeat, and another for the fold within repeat (folds are nested within repeats for 3x10-fold cross-validation). We report the 95% (equal-tailed) Bayesian CIs from the posterior probability distributions for our models’ auROCs. If 95% Bayesian CIs do not include 0.5 (chance performance), we can conclude that the model performs better than chance. We also report 95% (equal-tailed) Bayesian CIs for the differences in performance associated with the Bayesian comparisons. If the 95% Bayesian CI around a difference in performance does not include 0, we can conclude that one model performs better than the other.</p>
<p>Bayesian analyses were accomplished using the tidyposterior <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022">(<a href="#ref-kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn 2022</a>)</span> and rstanarm <span class="citation" data-cites="goodrichRstanarmBayesianApplied2023">(<a href="#ref-goodrichRstanarmBayesianApplied2023" role="doc-biblioref">Goodrich et al. 2023</a>)</span> packages in R.

Specifically, the priors were set as follows: residual standard deviation ~ normal(location=XX, scale=exp(XX)), intercept (after centering predictors) ~ normal(location=2.3, scale=1.3), the two coefficients for window width contrasts ~ normal (location=0, scale=2.69), and covariance ~ decov(regularization=1, concentration=1, shape=1, scale=1). <!-- UPDATE PRIORS these are from EMA, i don't know if i use specified priors or adjusted priors --></p>

<p>We calculated Shapley values by conducting leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) using the final, best selected model configuration. LOOCV works identically to <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation described above, where <em>k</em> = <em>N</em> (sample size) such that each test set consists of a single held-out participant. Thus, we fit <em>N</em> = 1086 models, where each participant served as the test set once for a model fit with the other 1085 participants. This allowed us to calculate Shapley values in held-out data, while ensuring our model stayed as close as possible to the final model (using the full dataset) that we would disseminate going forward.</p>
<p>We used the DALEX and DALEXtra packages <span class="citation" data-cites="biecekDALEXExplainersComplex2018">(<a href="#ref-biecekDALEXExplainersComplex2018" role="doc-biblioref">Biecek 2018</a>)</span> in R, which provide Shapley values in log-odds units for binary classification models. These Shapley values estimate local importance (i.e., for each observation). To calculate global importance (i.e., across all observations), we averaged the absolute value of the Shapley values of each feature across observations. These local and global importance scores based on Shapley values allow us to answer questions of relative feature importance; however, these are descriptive analyses because standard errors or other indices of uncertainty for importance scores are not yet available for Shapley values.</p>
<!-- TBD:
The additivity property of Shapley values allowed us also to examine the relative importance of categories of features. We created two kinds of feature categories. First, we examined feature importance within a single self-report measure (e.g., all features derived from items from a specific measure). Second, we examined feature importance within a domain: demographic features, mental health features, physical health features, smoking use history, and social/environmental features. To calculate the local importance for each category of features, we added Shapley values across all features in a category, separately for each observation. To calculate global feature importance for each feature category, we averaged the absolute value of the Shapley values of all features in the category across all observations.

nts: "domain" grouping (second idea in above paragraph) was used similarly by PATH paper, and i liked it there

<p>We followed closely methods described and used previously for evaluating the potential clinical utility of treatment selection models <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisPersonalizedAdvantageIndex2014">(<a href="#ref-derubeisPersonalizedAdvantageIndex2014" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis et al. 2014</a>)</span>. We also preregistered our analyses to evaluate clinical benefit; the preregistration can be found on our OSF page (<a href="https://osf.io/qad4n/">https://osf.io/qad4n/</a>).</p>
<section id="identify-model-predicted-best-treatment" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identify-model-predicted-best-treatment">Identify model-predicted best treatment</h4>
<p>As we did for feature importance, we conducted LOOCV such that we fit 1086 models using the best model configuration (selected in 1x-10-fold cross-validation) with each participant held-out from model fitting once. For each participant, we fit a model using the other 1085 participants and made predictions for the single held-out participant. This ensured that we were making predictions for a new patient (i.e., one that our model had not seen) to match most closely how this model would be ultimately implemented.</p>
<p>We calculated three predictions for each participant by substituting each treatment into the model inputs. Thus, there is one prediction per person per treatment. These substitutions affected the model’s predicted probabilities through any main effect of treatment and any interactions of treatment with other features. The treatment that yields the highest model-predicted probability of abstinence is identified as that participant’s “best” treatment.</p>
<p>For example, an individual may have received varenicline in the original trial. We calculated their probability of abstinence using their data (i.e., with varenicline as the “treatment” feature), and then we calculated two additional probabilities by substituting C-NRT and nicotine patch for varenicline. Among these three predicted probabilities, their probability of abstinence may be highest when C-NRT is substituted in as their treatment. This would mean C-NRT is identified as the best treatment for that individual.</p>
</section>
<section id="categorize-treatment-matching" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="categorize-treatment-matching">Categorize treatment matching</h4>
<p>Some participants’ best treatment matched what they were randomly assigned in the original trial. Other participants may have received a sub-optimal treatment (i.e., what the model identified as their second-best or worst treatment based on calculated probabilities). Thus, participants’ RCT-assigned treatment can be categorized by whether it “matched” their model-selected treatment.</p>
<p>For example, the individual described above received varenicline in the original trial, but their model-predicted probability of abstinence was highest when C-NRT was substituted in as their treatment. This participant’s best treatment did not match their trial treatment, so they would be labeled as “unmatched.”</p>
</section>
<section id="evaluate-clinical-benefit" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluate-clinical-benefit">Evaluate clinical benefit</h4>
<p>Our primary analysis to evaluate the clinical benefit of our model-selected treatment compared the observed outcomes (i.e., abstinence vs.&nbsp;smoking from the original trial) for people who did or did not receive their best treatment (i.e., matched or unmatched). Treatment matching was thus a between-subjects predictor and was coded as 0.5 (TRUE, “matched”) vs.&nbsp;-0.5 (FALSE, “unmatched”).</p>
<p>We examined this effect over time at 4, 12, and 26 weeks by allowing the effect of treatment match to interact with time (i.e., week). Time was a within-subjects variable with three repeated measures for each participant. We treated time numerically, and we used a log transformation to meet linearity assumptions. We preregistered using a log transformation with base e; however, due to issues of convergence, we switched to log base 2.</p>
<p>Our model included treatment match, time, the interaction between treatment match and time, a by-subject random slope for time, and a by-subject random intercept. We followed a mixed-effects modeling approach using the blme package [chungNondegeneratePenalizedLikelihood2013a]. Specifically, we fit a partially Bayesian generalized linear model that uses regularizing priors to force the estimated random effects variance-covariance matrices away from singularity [chungNondegeneratePenalizedLikelihood2013a]. If the interaction between treatment match and time was significant, we planned to conduct follow-up tests of the simple effect of treatment match at each time point (week 4, week 12, and week 26) using general linear models.</p>
<p>We identified the main effect of treatment match <em>a priori</em> as our focal effect; however, we report all estimates, test statistics, <em>p</em>-values, and confidence intervals from all models.</p>

<p>We selected the best model configurations using auROCs from the <em>validation sets</em>. We report the median and IQR auROCs from the validation sets for these best model configurations in the Supplement. We evaluated these best model configurations using <em>test set</em> performance to remove optimization bias present in performance metrics from validation sets [krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014].</p>
<p>The median auROC across the 30 test sets for the 4-week model was 0.682 (IQR = 0.654 - 0.712, range = 0.589 - 0.797). The median auROC across the 30 test sets for the 26-week model was 0.645 (IQR = 0.605 - 0.672, range = 0.513 - 0.762). These values are comparable to model performance from extant literature predicting smoking cessation using machine learning (e.g., auROC = 0.660 <span class="citation" data-cites="laiDevelopmentMachineLearning2021">(<a href="#ref-laiDevelopmentMachineLearning2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lai et al. 2021</a>)</span>). Additional performance metrics (not used for selection or primary evaluation) are reported in the Supplement.</p>
<p>We used the 30 test set auROCs to estimate the posterior probability distribution for the auROC of these models. The median auROCs from these posterior distributions were 0.687 (4-week model) and 0.639 (26-week model). These values represent our best estimates for the magnitude of the auROC parameter for each model. The 95% Bayesian CI for the auROCs were relatively narrow and did not contain 0.5 (chance performance) for either the 4-week model [0.666 - 0.707] or the 26-week model [0.617 - 0.661].

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameter-estimates-for-retained-variables">Parameter estimates for retained variables</h4>
<p>The glmnet algorithm offers two advantages with respect to understanding variable importance. First, as a linear model, it outputs parameter estimates for each feature. Second, the algorithm performs regularization using the hyperparameter alpha. This hyperparameter penalizes model complexity by shrinking parameter estimates and/or removing unnecessary or highly correlated features from the model entirely. Thus, features are retained in the model only to the degree to which their contribution to performance outweighs the cost of having an additional parameter in the model. Consequently, we can review the retained features as a metric of feature importance. <!-- not sure if i need this here now that i have detailed justification for glmnet in the methods --></p>
<p>Table X presents the retained features from the best 4-week model configuration and their parameter estimates. This model retained 128 features (best model configuration alpha = 0.1, item feature set). Of the 128 retained features, 56 were treatment interaction features, suggesting the importance of these interactions for prediction. To perform treatment selection, only interactive features would need to be assessed, as features that increase or decrease probability magnitude equally across all three treatments do not help with differential prediction. Consequently, implementing this model for treatment selection would require assessing only 37 unique items (e.g., multiple dummy variables are from a single item, a feature interacts with two levels of treatment).</p>
<p>Table X presents the retained features from the best 26-week model configuration and their parameter estimates. This model retained 38 features (best model configuration alpha = 0.3, scale feature set). Of the 38 retained features, 10 were treatment interaction variables, suggesting the importance of these interactions for prediction. To implement this model for treatment selection, this model would require assessing only 13 unique items (some retained items constituted scale scores and required assessing multiple items to calculate).</p>

<p>Global importance (mean |Shapley value|) for features for each model appear in Panel A of Figure X. XX was the most important feature across prediction outcomes. XX, XX, and XX were also globally important across models. XX, XX, and XX were the most relatively important treatment interaction variables. XX was globally important for only the 4-week model, whereas XX was globally important for only the 26-week model.</p>
<!-- not sure if i will need these? less relevant for my context/purpose -->
<p>Sina plots of local Shapley values (i.e., the influence of features on individual observations) for each model show that some features (e.g., XX, XX, XX) impact abstinence probability for specific individuals even if they are not globally important across all observations (Figure X, Panels B-C).</p>

<p>There was a significant fixed effect of treatment matching on abstinence (OR = , <em>z</em> = 5.640, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Individuals who received their model-predicted best treatment were more likely to be abstinent. There was also a significant fixed effect of time (OR = , <em>z</em> = -9.948, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) such that the probability of abstinence declined over time.</p>
<p>There was not a significant interaction between treatment matching and time (<em>p</em> = 0.830). However, calculating and interpreting interactions in logistic models is not straightforward because significance can differ based on the link function used <span class="citation" data-cites="karaca-mandicInteractionTermsNonlinear2012 collinsOptimizationBehavioralBiobehavioral2018">(<a href="#ref-karaca-mandicInteractionTermsNonlinear2012" role="doc-biblioref">Karaca-Mandic, Norton, and Dowd 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-collinsOptimizationBehavioralBiobehavioral2018" role="doc-biblioref">Collins 2018</a>)</span>. Consequently, we conducted simple effects analyses of the effect of treatment matching at each time point <!-- add a footnote that this differed from our preregistration -->.

<p>There was a significant fixed effect of treatment matching on abstinence at 4 weeks (OR = , <em>z</em> = , <em>p</em> = ) and at 12 weeks (OR = , <em>z</em> = , <em>p</em> = ).

<!-- IGNORE FOR NOW

from nrsa innovation & impact:

The proposed project combines machine learning with precision mental health to select among treatments for cigarette smoking cessation. Machine learning remains novel and underused in substance use and, to some degree, clinical psychology broadly16. Further, prior machine learning research for SUDs has prioritized diagnosis and screening17–20 over treatment selection, highlighting the novelty of this project.

This project is also innovative in that it will consider a wide variety of features within and across domains (e.g., smoking history, other substance use, psychological traits/conditions, physical health, demographics, social environment). Machine learning methods allow me to incorporate these features simultaneously and build high-dimensional models that capture real-world complexities. Including features across domains invites interactions among features and subsequent integration of knowledge across domains. The proposed project will allow features often considered disparate to interact with one another, permitting combinations of features that are both guided by domain expertise and driven by less intuitive patterns in the data.

This project could provide immediate impact by offering a decision-making tool for selecting among smoking cessation treatments. My model would provide patient-level guidance for treatment selection among smoking cessation treatments, which would reduce health risks and societal burdens. Critically, this approach could offer those benefits without requiring new treatment development, which is time- and resource-intensive. Instead, we can improve treatment effectiveness by optimizing therapeutic benefit of existing treatments. 

I aim to increase potential impact by allowing feasibility to guide model development. I will prioritize sparse models with readily available, easy-to-measure features to the degree that these models yield robust treatment selection. The available features set can be easily measured via self-report. Easy measurement would allow our decision-making tool to be implemented without blood draws, expensive or otherwise inaccessible testing (e.g., neuroimaging), formal clinical interviewing, or even in-person doctors’ visits. In fact, prioritizing feasibility is a primary rationale for excluding genetic features from the present project; genetic features would require specialty materials and/or in-person medical appointments during clinical implementation. An assessment constructed entirely from self-report measurements is particularly valuable because two treatments in the model (nicotine patch, combination NRT) are widely available over the counter, offering scalable implementation even when medical access is limited. This focus on feasibility (i.e., using low burden, low-cost features) could maximize potential clinical benefit. These efforts are especially warranted when applying the precision mental health paradigm to SUDs, for which large health disparities on the bases of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location persist.
