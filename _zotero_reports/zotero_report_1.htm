					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this analysis of current data from a nationally 
representative U.S. survey, smoking was associated with a reduction in 
life expectancy of 10 years, and the excess risk was reduced by about 
90% among smokers who quit by 40 years of age. Smoking is a major cause 
of premature death worldwide.1–3 Despite substantial declines in the 
prevalence of smoking by adults, estimates based on extrapolation from 
studies in the 1980s suggest that for those between 35 and 69 years of 
age, smoking currently accounts for almost 200,000 deaths annually in 
the United States, or about one fourth of all deaths in this age 
group.4–6 The prevalence of smoking peaked around 1960 among U.S. men 
and about two decades later among U.S. women.7,8 Rates of death from 
vascular disease have decreased substantially since the 1980s owing to 
reductions in smoking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>OBJECTIVE To summarize the U.S. Public Health Service 
guideline Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update, which 
provides recommendations for clinical interventions and system changes 
to promote the treatment of tobacco dependence. PARTICIPANTS An 
independent panel of 24 scientists and clinicians selected by the U.S. 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on behalf of the U.S. Public 
Health Service. A consortium of eight governmental and nonprofit 
organizations sponsored the update. EVIDENCE Approximately 8700 
English-language, peer-reviewed articles and abstracts, published 
between 1975 and 2007, were reviewed for data that addressed assessment 
and treatment of tobacco dependence. This literature served as the basis
 for more than 35 meta-analyses. CONSENSUS PROCESS Two panel meetings 
and numerous conference calls and staff meetings were held to evaluate 
meta-analyses and relevant literature, to synthesize the results, and to
 develop recommendations. The updated guideline was then externally 
reviewed by more than 90 experts, made available for public comment, and
 revised. CONCLUSIONS This evidence-based, updated guideline provides 
specific recommendations regarding brief and intensive tobacco-cessation
 interventions as well as system-level changes designed to promote the 
assessment and treatment of tobacco use. Brief clinical approaches for 
patients willing and unwilling to quit are described.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Most cigarette smokers want to quit smoking and more than half
 make an attempt every year, but less than 10% remain abstinent for at 
least 6 months. Evidence-based tobacco use treatment improves the 
likelihood of quitting, but more than two-thirds of individuals relapse 
when provided even the most robust treatments. Identifying for whom 
treatment is effective will improve the success of our treatments and 
perhaps identify strategies for improving current approaches.Two cohorts
 (training: N = 90, validation: N = 71) of cigarette smokers enrolled in
 group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Generalized estimating 
equations were used to identify baseline predictors of outcome, as 
defined by breath carbon monoxide and urine cotinine. Significant 
measures were entered as candidate variables to predict quit status. The
 resulting decision trees were used to predict cessation outcomes in a 
validation cohort.In the training cohort, the decision trees 
significantly improved on chance classification of smoking status 
following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The first split of all 
decision trees, which was delay discounting, significantly improved on 
chance classification rates in both the training and validation cohort. 
Delay discounting emerged as the single best predictor of group CBT 
treatment response with an average baseline discount rate of ln(k) = 
−7.1, correctly predicting smoking status of 80% of participants at 
posttreatment and 81% of participants at follow-up.This study provides a
 first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation though future
 work is needed to identify individuals that are likely to be successful
 in treatments beyond group CBT.This study provides a first step toward 
personalized care for smoking cessation. Using a novel machine-learning 
approach, baseline measures of clinical and executive functioning are 
used to predict smoking cessation outcomes following group CBT. A 
decision point is recommended for the single best predictor of treatment
 outcomes, delay discounting, to inform future research or clinical 
practice in an effort to better allocate patients to treatments that are
 likely to work.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when 
fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the 
number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are 
implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach
 to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to 
estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly 
informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the 
log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the
 estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default 
log-gamma(2,λ) penalty with λ→0, which ensures that the maximum 
penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from 
zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining 
consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that 
the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a
 good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a 
noninformative prior.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background
Individuals in the criminal justice system demonstrate high rates of 
cigarette use (70–80%) and low adherence to smoking cessation 
medication. Educational approaches have not been shown to promote 
adherence or cessation, though medication sampling has boosted both use 
and cessation. The objective of the present study was to determine 
whether In vivo nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling approach 
increases NRT adherence among criminal justice smokers during a 
subsequent quit attempt.
Methods
We conducted a pilot study with 43 community corrections smokers 
randomized to a 4-session (one 30-min session per week) precessation 
intervention of either In vivo NRT sampling (Session 1: patch; Session 
2: gum; Session 3: combination NRT (cNRT); Session 4: review) vs. 4 
time-matched sessions of standard smoking cessation with cNRT started 
after Session 1. Both groups received an additional 8weeks of cNRT 
following the four intervention sessions.
Results
During the in vivo administration of NRT, total withdrawal and craving 
severity significantly decreased from pre- to post-session compared to 
Control participants. In vivo participants evinced greater patch use at 
Session 4 and greater gum use through Week 8 relative to Controls.
Discussion
In vivo NRT sampling may increase NRT adherence relative to standard 
counseling sessions among criminal justice smokers. A larger trial of 
this novel intervention appears to be warranted.</td>

the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important 
modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. 
Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, 
shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, 
clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to
 illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to
 facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by 
practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter 
contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented 
in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two
 of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, 
Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for
 statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to 
Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level 
accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at 
statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge 
statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes 
only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix 
algebra.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Nicotine is metabolized into cotinine and then into 
trans-3′-hydroxycotinine, mainly by cytochrome P450 2A6. Recent studies 
reported better effectiveness of varenicline in women and in nicotine 
normal metabolizers phenotypically determined by nicotine-metabolite 
ratio. Our objective was to study the influence of nicotine-metabolite 
ratio, CYP2A6 genotype and sex on the response to nicotine replacement 
therapy and varenicline. Data were extracted from a longitudinal study 
which included smokers participating in a smoking cessation program. 
Response to treatment was defined by the absence of relapse when a set 
threshold of reduction in cigarettes per day relative to the week before
 the study was no more reached. The analysis considered total and 
partial reduction defined by a diminution of 100% and of 90% in 
cigarettes per day, respectively. The hazard ratio of relapsing was 
estimated in multivariate Cox regression models including the sex and 
the nicotine metabolism determined by the phenotype or by CYP2A6 
genotyping (rs1801272 and rs28399433). In the normal metabolizers 
determined by phenotyping and in women, the hazard ratio for relapsing 
was significantly lower with varenicline for a partial decrease (HR = 
0.33, 95% CI [0.12, 0.89] and HR = 0.20, 95% CI [0.04, 0.91], 
respectively) and nonsignificantly lower for a total cessation (HR = 
0.45, 95% CI [0.20, 1.0] and HR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.14, 1.0]). When 
compared with the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping, the 
hazard ratio for a partial decrease was similar in the normal 
metabolizers determined by genotyping (HR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.18, 0.94]) 
while it was significantly lower with varenicline for a total cessation 
(HR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.26, 0.98]). Women and normal nicotine metabolizers
 may benefit more from varenicline over nicotine replacement therapy.

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background: Justice-involved youth are at risk to become 
cigarette smokers as they age, leading to a variety of poor health 
outcomes. However, little is known about cigarette use among 
justice-involved youth, especially youth supervised in the community 
where there is ample opportunity to smoke. Objective: This study 
investigates the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the associations 
between cigarette smoking, emotional and behavioral functioning, and 
other substance use among a sample of first-time offending 
court-involved, non-incarcerated (FTO-CINI) youth. Methods: Youth were 
recruited from a family court in the Northeast (N = 423). Substance use 
was self-reported using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA). 
Emotional and behavioral functioning was measured using the Behavior 
Assessment Schedule for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2), the Affect 
Dysregulation Scale (ADS), National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short 
Scale (NSESSS), and the National Survey of Self-Reported Delinquency 
(NYS-SRD). Results: About 9.9% of FTO-CINI youth had smoked cigarettes 
in the past 30 days. Compared with FTO-CINI youth who had not smoked 
recently, recent smokers endorsed more emotional and behavioral 
symptoms, such as school problems (p &lt; .001), internalizing problems 
(p = .012), inattention/hyperactivity (p = .020), affect dysregulation 
(p = .044), PTSD symptoms (p = .006), and delinquent behavior (p &lt; 
.001). Recent smokers were also more likely to use alcohol (OR = 5.61, p
 &lt; .001), marijuana (OR = 11.27, p &lt; .001), and other drugs (OR = 
5.00, p &lt; .001). Conclusions: Recent smoking was higher among 
FTO-CINI youth than youth in the general population. Findings underscore
 the need to incorporate nicotine into existing substance use prevention
 interventions for this population, who are at high risk to initiate 
cigarette use as they age.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease 
and death in the United States, resulting in approximately 480,000 
premature deaths and more than $300 billion in direct health care 
expenditures and productivity losses each year (1). To assess progress 
toward achieving the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing the 
percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes to ≤12.0%,* CDC assessed 
the most recent national estimates of smoking prevalence among adults 
aged ≥18 years using data from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey
 (NHIS). The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined 
from 20.9% in 2005 to 16.8% in 2014. Among daily cigarette smokers, 
declines were observed in the percentage who smoked 20–29 cigarettes per
 day (from 34.9% to 27.4%) or ≥30 cigarettes per day (from 12.7% to 
6.9%). In 2014, prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among males, 
adults aged 25–44 years, multiracial persons and American Indian/Alaska 
Natives, persons who have a General Education Development certificate, 
live below the federal poverty level, live in the Midwest, are insured 
through Medicaid or are uninsured, have a disability or limitation, or 
are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Proven population-based interventions, 
including tobacco price increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, high 
impact mass media campaigns, and barrier-free access to quitting 
assistance, are critical to reduce cigarette smoking and smoking-related
 disease and death among U.S. adults.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Predictive modeling is invaded by elastic, yet complex methods
 such as neural networks or ensembles (model stacking, boosting or 
bagging). Such methods are usually described by a large number of 
parameters or hyper parameters - a price that one needs to pay for 
elasticity. The very number of parameters makes models hard to 
understand. This paper describes a consistent collection of explainers 
for predictive models, a.k.a. black boxes. Each explainer is a technique
 for exploration of a black box model. Presented approaches are 
model-agnostic, what means that they extract useful information from any
 predictive method irrespective of its internal structure. Each 
explainer is linked with a specific aspect of a model. Some are useful 
in decomposing predictions, some serve better in understanding 
performance, while others are useful in understanding importance and 
conditional responses of a particular variable. Every explainer 
presented here works for a single model or for a collection of models. 
In the latter case, models can be compared against each other. Such 
comparison helps to find strengths and weaknesses of different models 
and gives additional tools for model validation. Presented explainers 
are implemented in the DALEX package for R. They are based on a uniform 
standardized grammar of model exploration which may be easily extended.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Introduction:
Tobacco use causes one premature death every six seconds. Current 
smoking cessation aids include nicotine replacement therapies and 
bupropion. Although more than 70% of smokers express a desire to quit, 
fewer than 3% remain abstinent for more than one year, highlighting a 
critical need for more efficacious smoking cessation treatments.

Areas Covered:
The authors discuss the rationale, preclinical and clinical development 
of varenicline for smoking cessation. They cover the formulation of 
varenicline as a partial agonist at α4β2 receptors, the primary neural 
substrate for nicotine reward. Then, they discuss evidence from 
preclinical studies indicating varenicline’s efficacy in blocking 
nicotine reward, followed by clinical trials demonstrating safety and 
efficacy in sustaining abstinence in smokers. Finally, they cover 
post-market surveillance, including contraindications in heavy machine 
operators, putative cardiovascular risk, and the repealed warning for 
adverse neuropsychiatric events.

Expert opinion:
Varenicline development was based on strong theoretical rationale and 
preclinical evidence. Clinical studies indicate that varenicline is safe
 and more effective in sustaining abstinence than placebo, bupropion or 
nicotine replacement therapies. However, given that continuous 
abstinence rates across studies remain low (18~30% with varenicline; 
4~10% with placebo), novel and more effective medications targeting 
other nicotinic or glutamate receptors for smoking cessation are 
required.</td>

						<td>INTRODUCTION: Nicotine dependence is a chronic disorder often 
characterized by multiple failed quit attempts (QAs). Yet, little is 
known about the sequence of methods used across multiple QAs or how this
 may impact future ability to abstain from smoking. This prospective 
cohort study examines the effectiveness of switching smoking-cessation 
medications (SCMs) across multiple QAs.
METHODS: Adult smokers (aged ≥18 years) participating in International 
Tobacco Control surveys in the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada, and 
Australia (N=795) who: (1) completed two consecutive surveys between 
2006 and 2011; (2) initiated a QA at least 1 month before each survey; 
and (3) provided data for the primary predictor (SCM use during most 
recent QA), outcome (1-month point prevalence abstinence), and relevant 
covariates. Analyses were conducted in 2016.
RESULTS: Five SCM user classifications were identified: (1) non-users 
(43.5%); (2) early users (SCM used for initial, but not subsequent QA; 
11.4%); (3) later users (SCM used for subsequent, but not initial QA; 
18.4%); (4) repeaters (same SCM used for both QAs; 10.7%); and (5) 
switchers (different SCM used for each QA; 14.2%). Abstinence rates were
 lower for non-users (15.9%, OR=0.48, p=0.002), early users (16.6%, 
OR=0.27, p=0.03), and repeaters (12.4%, OR=0.36, p=0.004) relative to 
switchers (28.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest smokers will be more successful if they 
use a SCM in QAs and vary the SCM they use across time. That smokers can
 increase their odds of quitting by switching SCMs is an important 
message that could be communicated to smokers.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>IMPORTANCE: Smoking cessation medications are routinely used 
in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most 
effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination 
nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week
 quit rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three-group randomized 
intention-to-treat clinical trial occurring from May 2012 to November 
2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, communities; 65.5% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) 
refused participation prior to randomization.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week 
open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch 
only (n = 241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; 
n = 424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge; n = 421). 
Six counseling sessions were offered.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was carbon 
monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26
 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 
initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and 
point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52.
RESULTS: Among 1086 smokers randomized (52% women; 67% white; mean age, 
48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84%) provided 
12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence 
outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence
 at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8% [55/241]; varenicline, 23.6% 
[100/424]; and C-NRT, 26.8% [113/421]) or at 52 weeks (nicotine patch, 
20.8% [50/241]; varenicline, 19.1% [81/424]; and C-NRT, 20.2% [85/421]).
 At 26 weeks, the risk differences for abstinence were, for patch vs 
varenicline, -0.76% (95% CI, -7.4% to 5.9%); for patch vs C-NRT, -4.0% 
(95% CI, -10.8% to 2.8%); and for varenicline vs C-NRT, -3.3% (95% CI, 
-9.1% to 2.6%). All medications were well tolerated, but varenicline 
produced more frequent adverse events than did the nicotine patch for 
vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and 
indigestion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 
weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or C-NRT
 produced no significant differences in biochemically confirmed rates of
 smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise questions about the 
relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies.

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Objectives The number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to 
quit successfully is a commonly reported figure among smoking cessation 
programmes, but previous estimates have been based on lifetime recall in
 cross-sectional samples of successful quitters only. The purpose of 
this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior 
to quitting successfully.
Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to 
quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of 
smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We 
calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully 
under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of 
assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the 
declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the 
cohort.
Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before 
quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent 
with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the
 method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach 
including previous recall history.
Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to 
quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these 
estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and 
relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for 
many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being 
successful may assist with clinical expectations.</td>

 a high number of quit attempts needed to quit was found on average in 
this study, many individual smokers are able to quit successfully on 
relatively few attempts.21 Ashley et al22 suggested that between 40% and
 52% of former smokers quit the first time they make a serious attempt 
to do so. This is consistent with the assumption that quit attempts are 
not independent—those who have difficulty quitting will need to make 
many more quit attempts to succeed than those who have less difficulty. 
While many people may be able to quit smoking on the first few attempts,

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Empirical research in learning algorithms for classification 
tasks generally requires the use of significance tests. The quality of a
 test is typically judged on Type I error (how often the test indicates a
 difference when it should not) and Type II error (how often it 
indicates no difference when it should). In this paper we argue that the
 replicability of a test is also of importance. We say that a test has 
low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular 
random partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present 
empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the 
performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving 
standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets. Based on our 
results we give recommendations on which test to use.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>It is unclear if genetic variants affect smoking cessation 
treatment response. This study tested whether variants in the 
cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit (CHRNA5) predict response
 to smoking cessation medication by directly comparing the two most 
effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. In this 
genotype-stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial (May 2015–August 2019 in St Louis, Missouri), smokers 
were randomized by genotype in blocks of six (1:1:1 ratio) to three 
conditions: 12 weeks of placebo (n = 273), combination nicotine patch 
and lozenge (combination nicotine replacement therapy, cNRT, n = 275), 
or varenicline (n = 274). All participants received counseling and were 
followed for 12 months. The primary end point was biochemically verified
 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT, week 
12). Trial registration and eligibility criteria are on 
clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT02351167). We 
conducted the genetic analyses separately for 516 European ancestry (EA)
 smokers and 306 non-EA smokers (including 270 African American 
smokers). In African American smokers, there was a genotype-by-treatment
 interaction for EOT abstinence (χ2 = 10.7, degrees of freedom = 2. P = 
0.0049): specifically, cNRT was more effective in smokers with 
rs16969968 GG genotype than was placebo, while varenicline was more 
effective in smokers of GA/AA genotypes. In EA ancestry smokers, there 
was no significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. In the whole 
sample, although both were effective at EOT, only varenicline, and not 
cNRT, was significantly effective relative to placebo at 6-month 
follow-up. Importantly, this study suggests that genetic information can
 further enhance smoking cessation treatment effectiveness.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Objectives To explain the use of interaction terms in 
nonlinear models. Study Design We discuss the motivation for including 
interaction terms in multivariate analyses. We then explain how the 
straightforward interpretation of interaction terms in linear models 
changes in nonlinear models, using graphs and equations. We extend the 
basic results from logit and probit to difference-in-differences models,
 models with higher powers of explanatory variables, other nonlinear 
models (including log transformation and ordered models), and panel data
 models. Empirical Application We show how to calculate and interpret 
interaction effects using a publicly available Stata data set with a 
binary outcome. Stata 11 has added several features which make those 
calculations easier. LIMDEP code also is provided. Conclusions It is 
important to understand why interaction terms are included in nonlinear 
models in order to be clear about their substantive interpretation.</td>

 addition of a binary explanatory variable like female to the logit or 
probit model (as shown on the right‐hand side of equation 2) shifts the 
S‐shaped curve (see Figure 2b). The marginal effect of age for a 20 year
 old now depends on the individual's sex, even though there is no 
interaction term in the model. Adding an interaction term to the model 
(corresponding to the righthand side of equation 3) yields the 
relationships shown in Figure 2c. When all the coefficients are 
positive, the effect of adding the interaction term is to make the curve
 for women more steeply sloped in the middle range of age. As in Figure

Some typical examples of the scale of interest in health services 
research include expenditures, and out‐of‐pocket costs in dollar 
amounts; utilization of health care services measured as inpatient, 
outpatient, emergency department visits, length of hospital stays; as 
well as probability of various outcomes such as any health care 
spending, any doctor visits, and indicators of unmet needs or other

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Genetic risk prediction is an important goal in human genetics
 research and precision medicine. Accurate prediction models will have 
great impacts on both disease prevention and early treatment strategies.
 Despite the identification of thousands of disease-associated genetic 
variants through genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk 
prediction accuracy remains moderate for most diseases, which is largely
 due to the challenges in both identifying all the functionally relevant
 variants and accurately estimating their effect sizes in the presence 
of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper, we introduce AnnoPred, a 
principled framework that leverages diverse types of genomic and 
epigenomic functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for complex
 diseases. AnnoPred is trained using GWAS summary statistics in a 
Bayesian framework in which we explicitly model various functional 
annotations and allow for linkage disequilibrium estimated from 
reference genotype data. Compared with state-of-the-art risk prediction 
methods, AnnoPred achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy in 
both extensive simulations and real data.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Identifying determinants of smoking cessation is critical for 
developing optimal cessation treatments and interventions. Machine 
learning (ML) is becoming more prevalent for smoking cessation success 
prediction in treatment programs. However, only individuals with an 
intention to quit smoking cigarettes participate in such programs, which
 limits the generalizability of the results. This study applies data 
from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), a United 
States longitudinal nationally representative survey, to select primary 
determinants of smoking cessation and to train ML classification models 
for predicting smoking cessation among the general population. An 
analytical sample of 9,281 adult current established smokers from the 
PATH survey wave 1 was used to develop classification models to predict 
smoking cessation by wave 2. Random forest and gradient boosting 
machines were applied for variable selection, and the SHapley Additive 
explanation method was used to show the effect direction of the 
top-ranked variables. The final model predicted wave 2 smoking cessation
 for current established smokers in wave 1 with an accuracy of 72% in 
the test dataset. The validation results showed that a similar model 
could predict wave 3 smoking cessation of wave 2 smokers with an 
accuracy of 70%. Our analysis indicated that more past 30 days 
e-cigarette use at the time of quitting, fewer past 30 days cigarette 
use before quitting, ages older than 18 at smoking initiation, fewer 
years of smoking, poly tobacco past 30-days use before quitting, and 
higher BMI resulted in higher chances of cigarette cessation for adult 
smokers in the US.</td>

 remember to make the point in intro when talking about other ml/pmh 
research that there ARE reasons that it’s important to predict smoking 
cessation (help to understand driving factors, learn about what factors 
maintain smoking/predict success/etc., help identify 
intervention/prevention/policy targets) --&gt; just not the same as PMH.
 and doesn’t automatically lead to PMH like many studies claim</p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Machine learning approaches for clinical psychology and 
psychiatry explicitly focus on learning statistical functions from 
multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about 
individuals. The goal of this review is to provide an accessible 
understanding of why this approach is important for future practice 
given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using 
clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current 
statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an 
introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in 
clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming
 to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide 
evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial 
results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are 
addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are 
outlined.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This study provides a prospective fine-grain description of 
the incidence and pattern of intentions to quit, quit attempts, 
abstinence, and reduction in order to address several clinical questions
 about self-quitting.A total of 152 smokers who planned to quit in the 
next 3 months called nightly for 12 weeks to an Interactive Voice 
Response system to report cigarettes/day, quit attempts, intentions to 
smoke or not in the next day, and so forth. No treatment was 
provided.Most smokers (60%) made multiple transitions among smoking, 
reduction, and abstinence. Intention to not smoke or quit often did not 
result in a quit attempt but were still strong predictors of a quit 
attempt and eventual abstinence. Most quit attempts (79%) lasted less 
than 1 day; about one fifth (18%) of the participants were abstinent at 
12 weeks. The majority of quit attempts (72%) were not preceded by an 
intention to quit. Such quit attempts were shorter than quit attempts 
preceded by an intention to quit (&amp;lt;1 day vs. 25 days). Most 
smokers (67%) used a treatment, and use of a treatment was 
nonsignificantly associated with greater abstinence (14 days vs. 3 
days). Making a quit attempt and failing early predicted an increased 
probability of a later quit attempt compared to not making a quit 
attempt early (86% vs. 67%). Smokers often (17%) failed to report brief 
quit attempts on an end-of-study survey.Cessation is a more chronic, 
complex, and dynamic process than many theories or treatments assume.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Neurocognitive dysfunctions are frequently identified in the 
addictions. These dysfunctions may indicate either diffuse dysfunction 
or may represent separate facets that have differential importance to 
the addiction phenotype. In a sample (n = 260) of alcohol and/or 
stimulant users and controls we measured responses across 7 diverse 
neurocognitive measures. These measures were Continuous Performance, 
Delay Discounting, Iowa Gambling, Stroop, Tower, Wisconsin Card Sorting,
 and Letter Number Sequencing. Comparisons were then made between the 
drug-dependent groups and controls using analysis of variance and also 
using a machine learning approach to classify participants based on task
 performance as substance-dependent or controls in 1 tree and as alcohol
 and/or stimulant users or controls in a second tree. The analysis of 
variance showed significant differences between groups on the Delay 
Discounting (p &lt; .001), Iowa Gambling (p &lt; .001), Letter Number 
Sequencing (p &lt; .001), and Wisconsin Card Sorting (p &lt; .05) tasks.
 The first classification tree correctly classified between 
substance-dependent or controls for 88.3% of participants and classified
 between alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls for 63.9% of 
participants. Delay discounting was the first split in both trees and in
 the substance-dependent and control tree. The analysis of variance 
results largely replicate previous findings. The machine learning 
classification tree analysis provides evidence to support the hypothesis
 that different measures of neurocognitive dysfunction represent 
different processes. Among them, delay discounting was the most robust 
in categorizing drug dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA,

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background
        , When people stop smoking they experience cravings to smoke and
 unpleasant mood changes. Nicotine receptor partial agonists aim to 
reduce these withdrawal symptoms and the pleasure people usually 
experience when they smoke. The most widely‐available treatment in this 
drug type is varenicline, which is available world‐wide as an aid for 
quitting smoking. Cytisine is a similar medication, but is only 
available in Central and Eastern European countries and through internet
 sales., 
          Study characteristics
        , We searched for randomised controlled trials testing 
varenicline, cytisine or dianicline. We found 39 studies of varenicline 
compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. We also found four 
trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement 
therapy. We include one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in 
development, and so not available to use as a quitting aid. To be 
included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the 
start of treatment. We preferred the strictest available definition of 
quitting, and results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing 
blood or bodily fluids.We conducted full searches up to May 2015, 
although we have also included several key trials published after that 
date., 
          Key findings
        , From the information we found (27 trials, 12,625 people), 
varenicline at standard dose more than doubled the chances of quitting 
compared with placebo. Low‐dose varenicline (four trials, 1266 people) 
roughly doubled the chances of quitting, and reduced the number and 
severity of side effects. The number of people stopping smoking with 
varenicline was higher than with bupropion (five trials, 5877 people) or
 with NRT (eight trials, 6264 people). Based on the evidence so far, we 
can calculate that varenicline delivers one extra successful quitter for
 every 11 people treated, compared with smokers trying to quit without 
varenicline., The most common side effect of varenicline is nausea, but 
this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time. 
People taking varenicline appear to have about a 25% increased chance of
 a serious adverse event, although these include many which are 
unrelated to the treatment. We also note that more people were lost from
 the control groups than from the varenicline groups by the end of the 
trials, which may mean that the count of events in the control groups is
 lower than it should be. After varenicline became available to use, 
there were concerns that it could be linked with an increase in 
depressed mood, agitation, or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some 
smokers. However, the latest evidence does not support a link between 
varenicline and these disorders, although people with past or current 
psychiatric illness may be at slightly higher risk. There have also been
 concerns that varenicline may slightly increase heart and circulatory 
problems in people already at increased risk of these illnesses. The 
evidence is currently unclear whether or not they are caused or made 
worse by varenicline, but we should have clearer answers to these 
questions when a further study is published later this year., 
          Quality of the evidence
        , The varenicline studies were generally of high quality, 
providing evidence that we consider to be reliable and robust. We rate 
the quality of the evidence comparing varenicline with NRT as moderate 
quality (we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), 
since in some of them the participants knew which treatment they were 
receiving (i.e. non‐blinded open‐label trials). We judge the evidence 
from the cytsine trials to be of low quality (we have limited confidence
 in the evidence), as there are only two trials, with relatively low 
numbers included.</td>

 either ridge regression or partial least squares, and vary a number of 
design factors such as sample size n relative to number of variables p, 
and error variance. The investigation encompasses both the non-singular 
(i.e. n &gt; p) and the singular (i.e. n ≤ p) cases. The latter is now 
common in areas such as chemometrics but has as yet received little 
rigorous investigation. Results of the experiments enable us to reach 
some definite conclusions and to make some practical recommendations.</td>

 can be estimated when other link functions are used, such as the

requires particularly careful consideration (e.g., Karaca-Mandic, 
Norton, &amp; Dowd, 2012). It is important to note that any main effect 
or interaction that is significant when one link function is used may or
 may not be significant when a different link function is used. Linear 
transformations of variables do not affect the interpretation of effects
 and associated hypothesis tests in an ANOVA, but nonlinear 
transformations, such as squaring or log transformations, do affect the 
interpretation of both main effects and interactions, as well as tests 
of hypotheses involving these effects.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FGC22MBSK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22116%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A21497%2C%22type%22%3A%22book%22%2C%22collection-title%22%3A%22Statistics%20for%20Social%20and%20Behavioral%20Sciences%22%2C%22event-place%22%3A%22Cham%22%2C%22ISBN%22%3A%22978-3-319-72205-4%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22DOI%3A%2010.1007%2F978-3-319-72206-1%22%2C%22publisher%22%3A%22Springer%20International%20Publishing%22%2C%22publisher-place%22%3A%22Cham%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22DOI.org%20(Crossref)%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Optimization%20of%20Behavioral%2C%20Biobehavioral%2C%20and%20Biomedical%20Interventions%3A%20The%20Multiphase%20Optimization%20Strategy%20(MOST)%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Optimization%20of%20Behavioral%2C%20Biobehavioral%2C%20and%20Biomedical%20Interventions%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-72206-1%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Collins%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Linda%20M.%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222022%22%2C11%2C14%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222018%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22collinsOptimizationBehavioralBiobehavioral2018%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Collins, 2018, p. 116</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recent work has demonstrated that some functional categories 
of the genome contribute disproportionately to the heritability of 
complex diseases. Here, we analyze a broad set of functional elements, 
including cell-type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic 
contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599.
 To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score
 regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics 
while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally 
tractable at very large sample sizes, and leverages genome-wide 
information. Our results include a large enrichment of heritability in 
conserved regions across many traits; a very large immunological 
disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers; and 
many cell-type-specific enrichments including significant enrichment of 
central nervous system cell types in body mass index, age at menarche, 
educational attainment, and smoking behavior.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cigarette smoking is highly addictive and modern genetic 
research has identified robust genetic influences on nicotine 
dependence. An important step in translating these genetic findings to 
clinical practice is identifying the genetic factors affecting smoking 
cessation in order to enhance current smoking cessation treatments. We 
reviewed the significant genetic variants that predict nicotine 
dependence, smoking cessation, and response to cessation 
pharmacotherapy. These data suggest that genetic risks can predict 
smoking cessation outcomes and moderate the effect of pharmacological 
treatments. Some pharmacogenetic findings have been replicated in 
meta-analyses or in multiple smoking cessation trials. The variation in 
efficacy between smokers with different genetic markers supports the 
notion that personalized smoking cessation intervention based upon 
genotype could maximize the efficiency of such treatment while 
minimizing side effects, thus influencing the number needed to treat 
(NNT) and the number needed to harm. In summary, as precision medicine 
is revolutionizing healthcare, smoking cessation may be one of the first
 areas where genetic variants may identify individuals at increased 
risk. Current evidence strongly suggests that genetic variants predict 
cessation failure and that cessation pharmacotherapy effectiveness is 
modulated by biomarkers such as nicotinic cholinergic receptor α5 
subunit (CHRNA5) genotypes or nicotine metabolism ratio (NMR). These 
findings strengthen the case for the development and rigorous testing of
 treatments that target patients with different biological risk 
profiles.</td>

 growing evidence of genetic markers as predictor of prognosis and 
treatment response, translation into clinical practice requires much 
work due to many factors such as inconsistent evidence, little data in 
diverse ancestry populations, lack of available CLIAcertified fast 
genotyping for clinical use, and need for research on cost-effectiveness
 [2, 14, 17, 44, 54, 114, 115] . To implement precision medicine for 
smoking cessation treatment, there are potential barriers. Some people 
remain skeptical for the value of genetic testing while proven 
interventions for treating tobacco dependence, including simple

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of 
illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven
 to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe 
and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and 
varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to 
varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former 
socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, 
have also been tested for effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo 
and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or 
longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in 
achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there 
instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits?
METHODS: The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which 
include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but 
we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in 
particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and 
nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and 
cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor 
antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine,
 Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. 
Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least 
six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the 
incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the 
treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
(CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with 'smoking' in the 
title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in 
November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised 
version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we 
conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with
 placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious
 adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses 
covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and 
bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible 
interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 
respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with 
placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons 
between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86
 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95%
 CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 
1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% 
CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 
2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42;
 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination 
NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed
 single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly 
against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more 
effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a 
nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk 
ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse 
events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, 
our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the 
placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500.
 SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of 
neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events
 (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline 
trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 
1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no 
significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 
1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). 
Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to
 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the 
effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances 
of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a 
dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with 
NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is 
inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared 
with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid 
to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is 
now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and 
dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these 
treatments.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been
 shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and 
varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also 
improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the 
treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would 
mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of 
varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable
 treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Genomewide association studies (GWASs) across psychiatric 
phenotypes have shown that common genetic variants generally confer risk
 with small effect sizes (odds ratio &lt; 1.1) that additively 
contribute to polygenic risk. Summary statistics derived from large 
discovery GWASs can be used to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in 
independent, target data sets to examine correlates of polygenic 
disorder liability (e.g., does genetic liability to schizophrenia 
predict cognition?). The intuitive appeal and generalizability of PRS 
have led to their widespread use and new insights into mechanisms of 
polygenic liability. However, when currently applied across traits they 
account for small amounts of variance (&lt;3%), are relatively 
uninformative for clinical treatment, and, in isolation, provide no 
insight into molecular mechanisms. Larger GWASs are needed to increase 
the precision of PRS, and novel approaches integrating various data 
sources (e.g., multitrait analysis of GWASs) may improve the utility of 
current PRS.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This systematic review aims to characterize the utility of 
machine learning to identify the predictors of smoking cessation 
outcomes and identify the machine learning methods applied in this area.
 In the current study, multiple searches occurred through December 9, 
2022 in MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, 
EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, APA PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, and the IEEE Xplore were performed. Inclusion 
criteria included various machine learning techniques, studies reporting
 cigarette smoking cessation outcomes (smoking status and the number of 
cigarettes), and various experimental designs (e.g., cross-sectional and
 longitudinal). Predictors of smoking cessation outcomes were assessed, 
including behavioral markers, biomarkers, and other predictors. Our 
systematic review identified 12 papers fitting our inclusion criteria. 
In this review, we identified gaps in knowledge and innovation 
opportunities for machine learning research in the field of smoking 
cessation.</td>

 major limitation of this area of research is the paucity of inclusion 
of the neurobehavioral mechanisms underpinning smoking-related 
decision-making. The competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) 
theory postulates addiction in part arises from an imbalance in the 
executive and impulsive decision-making systems [53,54]. Delay 
discounting has been identified as an index of CNDS balance where 
individuals with higher delay discounting rates display hyperactivation 
in impulsive neural systems (e.g., limbic system regions) and 
hypoactivation of executive regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) [55]. 
Therefore, the inclusion of delay discounting and, perhaps, other 
neurocognitive decisionmaking constructs within machine learning and 
smoking cessation is a future direction that could identify novel 
therapeutic targets”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FGFKY3FDP%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23822%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22This%20systematic%20review%20aims%20to%20characterize%20the%20utility%20of%20machine%20learning%20to%20identify%20the%20predictors%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20outcomes%20and%20identify%20the%20machine%20learning%20methods%20applied%20in%20this%20area.%20In%20the%20current%20study%2C%20multiple%20searches%20occurred%20through%20December%209%2C%202022%20in%20MEDLINE%2C%20Science%20Citation%20Index%2C%20Social%20Science%20Citation%20Index%2C%20EMBASE%2C%20CINAHL%20Plus%2C%20APA%20PsycINFO%2C%20PubMed%2C%20Cochrane%20Central%20Register%20of%20Controlled%20Trials%2C%20and%20the%20IEEE%20Xplore%20were%20performed.%20Inclusion%20criteria%20included%20various%20machine%20learning%20techniques%2C%20studies%20reporting%20cigarette%20smoking%20cessation%20outcomes%20(smoking%20status%20and%20the%20number%20of%20cigarettes)%2C%20and%20various%20experimental%20designs%20(e.g.%2C%20cross-sectional%20and%20longitudinal).%20Predictors%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20outcomes%20were%20assessed%2C%20including%20behavioral%20markers%2C%20biomarkers%2C%20and%20other%20predictors.%20Our%20systematic%20review%20identified%2012%20papers%20fitting%20our%20inclusion%20criteria.%20In%20this%20review%2C%20we%20identified%20gaps%20in%20knowledge%20and%20innovation%20opportunities%20for%20machine%20learning%20research%20in%20the%20field%20of%20smoking%20cessation.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Addiction%20Neuroscience%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1016%2Fj.addicn.2023.100068%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%222772-3925%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Addict%20Neurosci%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22eng%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22PMID%3A%2037214256%5CnPMCID%3A%20PMC10194042%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22100068%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22PubMed%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Predictors%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20outcomes%20identified%20by%20machine%20learning%3A%20A%20systematic%20review%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Predictors%20of%20smoking%20cessation%20outcomes%20identified%20by%20machine%20learning%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%226%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Bickel%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Warren%20K.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Tomlinson%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Devin%20C.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Craft%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22William%20H.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Ma%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Manxiu%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Dwyer%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Candice%20L.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Yeh%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Yu-Hua%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Tegge%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Allison%20N.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Freitas-Lemos%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Roberta%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Athamneh%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Liqa%20N.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222023%22%2C6%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22bickelPredictorsSmokingCessation2023%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Bickel et al., 2023, p. 8</span>)</span></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The efficacy and safety of retreatment with varenicline in 
smokers attempting to quit were evaluated in this randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (Australia, Belgium,
 Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States). Participants were generally healthy adult smokers (≥
 10 cigarettes/day) with ≥ 1 prior quit attempt (≥ 2 weeks) using 
varenicline and no quit attempts in ≤ 3 months; they were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks' varenicline (n = 251) or placebo (n = 247) 
treatment, with individual counseling, plus 40 weeks' nontreatment 
follow-up. The primary efficacy end point was the carbon 
monoxide-confirmed (≤ 10 ppm) continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9-12,
 which was 45.0% (varenicline; n = 249) vs. 11.8% (placebo; n = 245; 
odds ratio: 7.08; 95% confidence interval: 4.34, 11.55; P &lt; 0.0001). 
Common varenicline group adverse events were nausea, abnormal dreams, 
and headache, with no reported suicidal behavior. Varenicline is 
efficacious and well tolerated in smokers who have previously taken it. 
Abstinence rates are comparable with rates reported for 
varenicline-naive smokers.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) graphs are a useful 
technique for organizing classiﬁers and visualizing their performance. 
ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent 
years have been increasingly adopted in the machine learning and data 
mining research communities. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, 
there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in 
practice. This article serves both as a tutorial introduction to ROC 
graphs and as a practical guide for using them in research.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) surveyed 866 
female prisoners about tobacco use and interest in a smoking cessation 
program. The 27-item questionnaire assessed basic demographic 
information; type of tobacco used, amounts and frequency of use, 
triggers for use, health status, family tobacco use and health status, 
money spent on tobacco products, cessation attempts, motivation and 
self-efficacy for smoking cessation, and interest in participating in a 
smoking cessation program. The majority of female inmates (73.9%) were 
current tobacco users and 71.5% smoked cigarettes, with a mean of 14.6 
cigarettes per day (cpd). Approximately 12.5% of current smokers 
reported a tobacco-related medical problem. Most (60.6%) had made at 
least one attempt to quit smoking and only 24.5% felt “very confident” 
that they could quit if they made an attempt. Overall, 64.2% of the 
smokers reported interest in participating in the smoking cessation 
program, with heavier smokers (71.4%) reporting the most interest in 
enrolling in the program. The high percentage of current tobacco users, 
high level of interest in smoking cessation, and presence of 
smoking-related health problems indicate a tremendous public and 
correctional health problem that is being ignored.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The impact of tobacco smoking treatment is determined by its 
reach into the smoking population and the effectiveness of its 
interventions. This review evaluates the reach and effectiveness of 
pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for smoking. 
Historically, the reach of smoking treatment has been low, and therefore
 its impact has been limited, but new reach strategies such as digital 
interventions and health care system changes offer great promise. 
Pharmacotherapy tends to be more effective than psychosocial 
intervention when used clinically, and newer pharmacotherapy strategies 
hold great promise of further enhancing effectiveness. However, new 
approaches are needed to advance psychosocial interventions; progress 
has stagnated because research and dissemination efforts have focused 
too narrowly on skill training despite evidence that its core content 
may be inconsequential and the fact that its mechanisms are either 
unknown or inconsistent with supporting theory. Identifying effective 
psychosocial content and its mechanisms of action could greatly enhance 
the effectiveness of counseling, digital, and web interventions.</td>

 three strategies reported most frequently (in overlapping categories) 
were giving up cigarettes at once (65.3%), gradually cutting back 
(62.0%), and using e-cigarettes (35.3%). Only 25% used nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT) medications (e.g., nicotine patches, gum, 
lozenges), and only 5.4% used tobacco quitlines (free, state-sponsored, 
telephone-based cessation counseling services). Among individuals who 
used only a single quitting strategy (25.3% of the sample), the most 
frequently used methods were giving up cigarettes all at once (14.7%), 
gradually cutting back (6.6%), and substituting e-cigarettes for 
cigarettes (1.1%). Other methods were reported by fewer than 1% of 
respondents. Thus, only a small proportion of individuals use 
evidence-based treatments to quit smoking.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23743%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22The%20impact%20of%20tobacco%20smoking%20treatment%20is%20determined%20by%20its%20reach%20into%20the%20smoking%20population%20and%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20its%20interventions.%20This%20review%20evaluates%20the%20reach%20and%20effectiveness%20of%20pharmacotherapy%20and%20psychosocial%20interventions%20for%20smoking.%20Historically%2C%20the%20reach%20of%20smoking%20treatment%20has%20been%20low%2C%20and%20therefore%20its%20impact%20has%20been%20limited%2C%20but%20new%20reach%20strategies%20such%20as%20digital%20interventions%20and%20health%20care%20system%20changes%20offer%20great%20promise.%20Pharmacotherapy%20tends%20to%20be%20more%20effective%20than%20psychosocial%20intervention%20when%20used%20clinically%2C%20and%20newer%20pharmacotherapy%20strategies%20hold%20great%20promise%20of%20further%20enhancing%20effectiveness.%20However%2C%20new%20approaches%20are%20needed%20to%20advance%20psychosocial%20interventions%3B%20progress%20has%20stagnated%20because%20research%20and%20dissemination%20efforts%20have%20focused%20too%20narrowly%20on%20skill%20training%20despite%20evidence%20that%20its%20core%20content%20may%20be%20inconsequential%20and%20the%20fact%20that%20its%20mechanisms%20are%20either%20unknown%20or%20inconsistent%20with%20supporting%20theory.%20Identifying%20effective%20psychosocial%20content%20and%20its%20mechanisms%20of%20action%20could%20greatly%20enhance%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20counseling%2C%20digital%2C%20and%20web%20interventions.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20Review%20of%20Clinical%20Psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-081219-090343%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221548-5943%2C%201548-5951%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%22Volume%2017%2C%202021%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22publisher%3A%20Annual%20Reviews%22%2C%22page%22%3A%221-30%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22www.annualreviews.org%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%3A%20A%20Report%20Card%20on%20Progress%20and%20Challenges%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Baker%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Timothy%20B.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22McCarthy%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Danielle%20E.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222021%22%2C5%2C7%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22bakerSmokingTreatmentReport2021%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 3</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FPG8ZBN46%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22C6K4WRT4%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B362.428%2C595.875%2C485.703%2C605.236%5D%2C%5B121.059%2C583.923%2C486.024%2C593.284%5D%2C%5B121.059%2C571.962%2C414.61%2C581.323%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D">“a

 self-report via ecological momentary assessment (electronic real-time 
assessment), researchers have repeatedly found that NRT works primarily 
by suppressing tobacco withdrawal symptoms, especially craving, early in
 the course of the quit attempt (Bolt et al. 2012, Ferguson et al. 
2006). Other mechanisms have also been implicated in varenicline’s 
therapeutic effects; for instance, (a) it may increase the reinforcing 
value of nonpharmacological events, perhaps mitigating withdrawal 
anhedonia (Schassburger et al. 2015); (b) it reduces the salience of 
smoking cues and allocation of attention to them (Fedota et al. 2015), 
perhaps accounting for reduced cigarette craving (Brandon et al. 2011, 
Franklin et al. 2011); and (c)asanα4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
partial agonist, it appears to blunt the rewarding effects of smoking 
(Lu et al. 2017, West et al. 2008).”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23743%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22The%20impact%20of%20tobacco%20smoking%20treatment%20is%20determined%20by%20its%20reach%20into%20the%20smoking%20population%20and%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20its%20interventions.%20This%20review%20evaluates%20the%20reach%20and%20effectiveness%20of%20pharmacotherapy%20and%20psychosocial%20interventions%20for%20smoking.%20Historically%2C%20the%20reach%20of%20smoking%20treatment%20has%20been%20low%2C%20and%20therefore%20its%20impact%20has%20been%20limited%2C%20but%20new%20reach%20strategies%20such%20as%20digital%20interventions%20and%20health%20care%20system%20changes%20offer%20great%20promise.%20Pharmacotherapy%20tends%20to%20be%20more%20effective%20than%20psychosocial%20intervention%20when%20used%20clinically%2C%20and%20newer%20pharmacotherapy%20strategies%20hold%20great%20promise%20of%20further%20enhancing%20effectiveness.%20However%2C%20new%20approaches%20are%20needed%20to%20advance%20psychosocial%20interventions%3B%20progress%20has%20stagnated%20because%20research%20and%20dissemination%20efforts%20have%20focused%20too%20narrowly%20on%20skill%20training%20despite%20evidence%20that%20its%20core%20content%20may%20be%20inconsequential%20and%20the%20fact%20that%20its%20mechanisms%20are%20either%20unknown%20or%20inconsistent%20with%20supporting%20theory.%20Identifying%20effective%20psychosocial%20content%20and%20its%20mechanisms%20of%20action%20could%20greatly%20enhance%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20counseling%2C%20digital%2C%20and%20web%20interventions.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20Review%20of%20Clinical%20Psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-081219-090343%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221548-5943%2C%201548-5951%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%22Volume%2017%2C%202021%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22publisher%3A%20Annual%20Reviews%22%2C%22page%22%3A%221-30%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22www.annualreviews.org%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%3A%20A%20Report%20Card%20on%20Progress%20and%20Challenges%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Baker%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Timothy%20B.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22McCarthy%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Danielle%20E.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222021%22%2C5%2C7%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22bakerSmokingTreatmentReport2021%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 7</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FPG8ZBN46%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22ESXRJBK6%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B207.218%2C213.222%2C410.968%2C222.583%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C201.261%2C410.957%2C210.622%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C189.165%2C410.977%2C198.669%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C177.356%2C410.977%2C186.717%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C165.395%2C410.973%2C174.756%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C153.443%2C410.952%2C162.804%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C141.491%2C410.984%2C150.852%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C129.529%2C410.986%2C138.89%5D%2C%5B46.35%2C117.434%2C410.988%2C126.938%5D%2C%5B46.349%2C105.616%2C410.935%2C114.977%5D%2C%5B46.349%2C93.664%2C410.987%2C103.025%5D%2C%5B46.349%2C81.712%2C410.987%2C91.073%5D%2C%5B46.349%2C69.75%2C207.007%2C79.111%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D">“While
 numerous genetic variants have been evaluated for this purpose, the 
most promising basis for precision medicine is the nicotine metabolite 
ratio (NMR), which indexes nicotine metabolism and is highly influenced 
by variants in the CYP2A6 gene. Cross-sectional studies have shown that 
individuals with slower nicotine metabolism report higher quit rates 
with NRT compared with smokers with normal or faster nicotine metabolism
 (Chenoweth et al. 2016, Kaufmann et al. 2015, Schnoll et al. 2009), 
whereas a nonrandomized prospective study showed that varenicline was 
more effective than NRT for faster metabolizers (Glatard et al. 2017, 
Shahab et al. 2019). A prospective NMR-stratified pharmacogenetic trial 
(N = 1,246) (Lerman et al. 2015) characterized participants as slow or 
fast metabolizers of nicotine and randomized them, stratified on 
metabolism speed, to placebo, nicotine patch, and varenicline 
conditions. The results showed that faster metabolizers had 
significantly higher abstinence rates at follow-up if treated with 
varenicline versus nicotine patch. Slow metabolizers exhibited similar 
quit rates across the two active treatments.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A23743%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22The%20impact%20of%20tobacco%20smoking%20treatment%20is%20determined%20by%20its%20reach%20into%20the%20smoking%20population%20and%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20its%20interventions.%20This%20review%20evaluates%20the%20reach%20and%20effectiveness%20of%20pharmacotherapy%20and%20psychosocial%20interventions%20for%20smoking.%20Historically%2C%20the%20reach%20of%20smoking%20treatment%20has%20been%20low%2C%20and%20therefore%20its%20impact%20has%20been%20limited%2C%20but%20new%20reach%20strategies%20such%20as%20digital%20interventions%20and%20health%20care%20system%20changes%20offer%20great%20promise.%20Pharmacotherapy%20tends%20to%20be%20more%20effective%20than%20psychosocial%20intervention%20when%20used%20clinically%2C%20and%20newer%20pharmacotherapy%20strategies%20hold%20great%20promise%20of%20further%20enhancing%20effectiveness.%20However%2C%20new%20approaches%20are%20needed%20to%20advance%20psychosocial%20interventions%3B%20progress%20has%20stagnated%20because%20research%20and%20dissemination%20efforts%20have%20focused%20too%20narrowly%20on%20skill%20training%20despite%20evidence%20that%20its%20core%20content%20may%20be%20inconsequential%20and%20the%20fact%20that%20its%20mechanisms%20are%20either%20unknown%20or%20inconsistent%20with%20supporting%20theory.%20Identifying%20effective%20psychosocial%20content%20and%20its%20mechanisms%20of%20action%20could%20greatly%20enhance%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20counseling%2C%20digital%2C%20and%20web%20interventions.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20Review%20of%20Clinical%20Psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-081219-090343%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221548-5943%2C%201548-5951%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%22Volume%2017%2C%202021%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22publisher%3A%20Annual%20Reviews%22%2C%22page%22%3A%221-30%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22www.annualreviews.org%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%3A%20A%20Report%20Card%20on%20Progress%20and%20Challenges%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22Smoking%20Treatment%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Baker%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Timothy%20B.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22McCarthy%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Danielle%20E.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222021%22%2C5%2C7%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22bakerSmokingTreatmentReport2021%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 7</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FPG8ZBN46%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22SCHL4NQP%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B58.301%2C57.798%2C410.976%2C67.159%5D%2C%5B46.349%2C45.846%2C319.112%2C55.207%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2F2G4XVT3S%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D">“A

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this paper, we demonstrate how the state-of-the-art machine
 learning and text mining techniques can be used to build effective 
social media-based substance use detection systems. Since a substance 
use ground truth is difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize 
system performance, we explore different feature learning methods to 
take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. We 
also demonstrate the benefit of using multi-view unsupervised feature 
learning to combine heterogeneous user information such as Facebook 
`"likes" and "status updates" to enhance system performance. Based on 
our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for predicting tobacco 
use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for drug use, all of which 
significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has also 
uncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior 
(e.g., word usage) and substance use.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often
 be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common 
example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported 
interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to 
recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. 
Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the 
identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match 
patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on 
individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with
 treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform 
treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in
 which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical 
decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use
 of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can 
be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting.
 It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how 
much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental 
health systems. It behooves the field to continue to learn and develop 
the most powerful methods that can produce generalizable knowledge that 
will advance the aims of precision mental health.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The decrease in smoking rates in North America has plateaued, 
underscoring the need for new approaches to treat nicotine dependence. 
Inter-individual differences in smoking behavior result, in part, from 
variation in the rate of CYP2A6 -mediated nicotine metabolism. A 
phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity is the nicotine metabolite ratio 
(NMR), the ratio of 3′hydroxycotinine/cotinine. The NMR is associated 
with smoking cessation. However, the NMR is also associated with genetic
 (eg, CYP2A6 genotype) and other (eg, sex and ethnicity) factors. Here 
we aimed to determine if previously identified non- CYP2A6 sources of 
variation in the NMR mitigated the association between the NMR and 
short-term abstinence.  The NMR was determined from blood samples 
collected at intake from daily smokers aged 18–65. 
Biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence (exhaled carbon 
monoxide level ≤ 8 ppm) was measured at 1 week following the target quit
 date in participants from a smoking cessation clinical trial 
(NCT01314001). Analyses were restricted to N = 462 blacks and N = 693 
whites in the intent-to-treat sample.  Lower NMR (&amp;lt;0.31) was 
associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence ( OR = 1.43; 
95% CI = 1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after 
controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and 
factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, 
ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, 
alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NMR was associated with 1-week 
smoking abstinence; NMR may be a useful addition to medication screening
 approaches evaluating treatments for nicotine dependence.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Advances in personalized medicine require the 
identification of variables that predict differential response to 
treatments as well as the development and refinement of methods to 
transform predictive information into actionable recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate and test a new method for integrating 
predictive information to aid in treatment selection, using data from a 
randomized treatment comparison.
METHOD: Data from a trial of antidepressant medications (N = 104) versus
 cognitive behavioral therapy (N = 50) for Major Depressive Disorder 
were used to produce predictions of post-treatment scores on the 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) in each of the two 
treatments for each of the 154 patients. The patient's own data were not
 used in the models that yielded these predictions. Five 
pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response 
(marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality 
disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression 
models, permitting the calculation of each patient's Personalized 
Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units.
RESULTS: For 60% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI≥3)
 was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When 
these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their 
"Optimal" treatment versus those assigned to their "Non-optimal" 
treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d = 0.58, 95% CI 
.17-1.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This approach to treatment selection, implemented in the 
context of two equally effective treatments, yielded effects that, if 
obtained prospectively, would rival those routinely observed in 
comparisons of active versus control treatments.</td>

 methods we describe produce point predictions of symptom severity at 
post-treatment for each individual in each of two interventions. The 
comparison of the two estimates yields an index, which we call the 
Personalized Advantage Index (PAI). The PAI identifies the treatment 
predicted to produce the better outcome for a given patient, and it 
provides the patient with a quantitative estimate of the magnitude by 
which that treatment is predicted to outperform the other. The utility

 can be seen, whereas for some patients the predicted advantage of being
 assigned to their Optimal treatment was large, for others it was very 
small. For 62 (40%) of the patients, the PAI did not meet the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criterion (three points 
on the HRSD) for a ‘‘clinically significant’’ difference. For such 
patients, little weight would be given to the model’s predictions in a 
treatment selection decision; other factors (e.g., cost or patient 
preference) would likely be used to guide treatment. We test our 
approach, therefore, using the full sample of 154 patients as well as a 
reduced sample of those 92 patients (60%) whose PAI was ‘‘clinically 
significant.’’”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FJXWUUKQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A21330%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22BACKGROUND%3A%20Advances%20in%20personalized%20medicine%20require%20the%20identification%20of%20variables%20that%20predict%20differential%20response%20to%20treatments%20as%20well%20as%20the%20development%20and%20refinement%20of%20methods%20to%20transform%20predictive%20information%20into%20actionable%20recommendations.%5CnOBJECTIVE%3A%20To%20illustrate%20and%20test%20a%20new%20method%20for%20integrating%20predictive%20information%20to%20aid%20in%20treatment%20selection%2C%20using%20data%20from%20a%20randomized%20treatment%20comparison.%5CnMETHOD%3A%20Data%20from%20a%20trial%20of%20antidepressant%20medications%20(N%E2%80%8A%3D%E2%80%8A104)%20versus%20cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy%20(N%E2%80%8A%3D%E2%80%8A50)%20for%20Major%20Depressive%20Disorder%20were%20used%20to%20produce%20predictions%20of%20post-treatment%20scores%20on%20the%20Hamilton%20Rating%20Scale%20for%20Depression%20(HRSD)%20in%20each%20of%20the%20two%20treatments%20for%20each%20of%20the%20154%20patients.%20The%20patient's%20own%20data%20were%20not%20used%20in%20the%20models%20that%20yielded%20these%20predictions.%20Five%20pre-randomization%20variables%20that%20predicted%20differential%20response%20(marital%20status%2C%20employment%20status%2C%20life%20events%2C%20comorbid%20personality%20disorder%2C%20and%20prior%20medication%20trials)%20were%20included%20in%20regression%20models%2C%20permitting%20the%20calculation%20of%20each%20patient's%20Personalized%20Advantage%20Index%20(PAI)%2C%20in%20HRSD%20units.%5CnRESULTS%3A%20For%2060%25%20of%20the%20sample%20a%20clinically%20meaningful%20advantage%20(PAI%E2%89%A53)%20was%20predicted%20for%20one%20of%20the%20treatments%2C%20relative%20to%20the%20other.%20When%20these%20patients%20were%20divided%20into%20those%20randomly%20assigned%20to%20their%20%5C%22Optimal%5C%22%20treatment%20versus%20those%20assigned%20to%20their%20%5C%22Non-optimal%5C%22%20treatment%2C%20outcomes%20in%20the%20former%20group%20were%20superior%20(d%E2%80%8A%3D%E2%80%8A0.58%2C%2095%25%20CI%20.17-1.01).%5CnCONCLUSIONS%3A%20This%20approach%20to%20treatment%20selection%2C%20implemented%20in%20the%20context%20of%20two%20equally%20effective%20treatments%2C%20yielded%20effects%20that%2C%20if%20obtained%20prospectively%2C%20would%20rival%20those%20routinely%20observed%20in%20comparisons%20of%20active%20versus%20control%20treatments.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22PloS%20One%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083875%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%221932-6203%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%221%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22PLoS%20One%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22eng%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22PMID%3A%2024416178%5CnPMCID%3A%20PMC3885521%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22e83875%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22PubMed%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22The%20Personalized%20Advantage%20Index%3A%20translating%20research%20on%20prediction%20into%20individualized%20treatment%20recommendations.%20A%20demonstration%22%2C%22title-short%22%3A%22The%20Personalized%20Advantage%20Index%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%229%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22DeRubeis%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Robert%20J.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Cohen%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Zachary%20D.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Forand%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Nicholas%20R.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Fournier%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Jay%20C.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Gelfand%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Lois%20A.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Lorenzo-Luaces%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Lorenzo%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222014%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22derubeisPersonalizedAdvantageIndex2014%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 4</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FXERXFMBD%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22EANNC539%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%235fb236%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B324.058%2C445.728%2C554.226%2C453.95%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C435.127%2C554.18%2C443.349%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C424.581%2C554.182%2C432.803%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C413.98%2C554.197%2C422.202%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C403.434%2C554.231%2C411.656%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C392.832%2C554.162%2C401.055%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C382.287%2C554.177%2C390.509%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C371.685%2C554.178%2C379.908%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C361.14%2C554.176%2C369.362%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C350.538%2C554.176%2C358.761%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C339.993%2C554.197%2C348.215%5D%2C%5B315.1%2C329.391%2C337.866%2C337.614%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FJXWUUKQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D">“A
 true prospective test of our approach would begin with a randomized 
trial of two interventions. A predictive model, as we have described 
here, would be derived from the data obtained during the randomized 
trial. The model would then be tested in sample of patients who seek 
treatment in the same clinic in which the randomized trial was 
performed, using the same treatments. Outcomes of patients who are 
randomized to one of two conditions would then be compared: (a) those 
whose treatment is determined by random assignment, as in the first

						<td>About three quarters of homeless adults in the United States 
smoke, but the coexisting psychiatric and addictive conditions and 
circumstances of homeless smokers fuel a fatalistic attitude among 
health professionals toward addressing tobacco use in this population. 
Although the prevalence of smoking in the United States has declined, 
vulnerable and marginalized groups continue to use tobacco at high 
rates. One such group is the 2.3 to 3.5 million people nationwide who 
are homeless in any given year. Approximately three quarters of homeless
 adults are cigarette smokers1 — a prevalence 4 times that in the U.S. 
adult population and 2.5 times that among impoverished Americans in 
general. The coexisting psychiatric and addictive conditions and life 
circumstances of homeless smokers have long fueled a fatalistic attitude
 among health care professionals toward addressing tobacco use in this 
population. We believe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers 
in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or 
condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will 
occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision 
making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of 
reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear 
reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk 
of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately 
assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model 
for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a 
set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, 
validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or 
prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was
 developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the 
literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and 
revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health 
care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during 
several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with 
the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement 
is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting 
of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the 
transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of 
the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction
 with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the 
editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is 
recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their 
submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org)., Editors’ note:

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Mental health researchers and clinicians have long sought 
answers to the question “What works for whom?” The goal of precision 
medicine is to provide evidence-based answers to this question. 
Treatment selection in depression aims to help each individual receive 
the treatment, among the available options, that is most likely to lead 
to a positive outcome for them. Although patient variables that are 
predictive of response to treatment have been identified, this knowledge
 has not yet translated into real-world treatment recommendations. The 
Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) and related approaches combine 
information obtained prior to the initiation of treatment into 
multivariable prediction models that can generate individualized 
predictions to help clinicians and patients select the right treatment. 
With increasing availability of advanced statistical modeling 
approaches, as well as novel predictive variables and big data, 
treatment selection models promise to contribute to improved outcomes in
 depression.</td>

 medicine1 has afforded major advances in cancer treatment (National 
Research Council 2011, Schwaederle et al. 2015). For example, 
chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non–small-cell lung carcinoma

 to no benefit of these drugs alone or in combination with chemotherapy 
(Pao &amp; Miller 2005). However, recent clinical trials have found 
significantly improved outcomes for these drugs, relative to 
chemotherapy, in a specific subset of NSCLC patients with tumor

 defined by a National Research Council report, precision medicine 
“refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual 
characteristics of each patient. It does not literally mean the creation
 of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather 
the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in 
their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or 
prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a 
specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be 
concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects
 for those who will not. Although the term ‘personalized medicine’ is

 select treatments for patients as a matter of course in every day 
practice. A clinician who attends to information about a specific 
client’s presentation will likely generate hypotheses about the client’s
 expected responses to potentially available treatments (Lorenzo-Luaces 
et al. 2015). These predictions may draw on a variety of sources, 
including a clinician’s history with clients with similar features, 
their experiences in training and supervision, reasoning based on 
theory, and the empirical literature on treatment response (Raza &amp; 
Holohan 2015). However, there is limited empirical literature to guide 
personalized, or precision, selection of treatments. Clinicians are 
therefore forced to practice what Perlis (2016) has dubbed “artisanal 
medicine.” Artisanal medicine is the practice of making treatment 
decisions in an idiosyncratic or unsystematic manner, or in a manner 
guided by theory and experience but largely uninformed by empirical 
evidence or feedback. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization that 
defines artisanal medicine limits the validity and utility of such 
approaches for decision making”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FV68XN5X3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22213%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A21331%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Mental%20health%20researchers%20and%20clinicians%20have%20long%20sought%20answers%20to%20the%20question%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20works%20for%20whom%3F%E2%80%9D%20The%20goal%20of%20precision%20medicine%20is%20to%20provide%20evidence-based%20answers%20to%20this%20question.%20Treatment%20selection%20in%20depression%20aims%20to%20help%20each%20individual%20receive%20the%20treatment%2C%20among%20the%20available%20options%2C%20that%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20lead%20to%20a%20positive%20outcome%20for%20them.%20Although%20patient%20variables%20that%20are%20predictive%20of%20response%20to%20treatment%20have%20been%20identified%2C%20this%20knowledge%20has%20not%20yet%20translated%20into%20real-world%20treatment%20recommendations.%20The%20Personalized%20Advantage%20Index%20(PAI)%20and%20related%20approaches%20combine%20information%20obtained%20prior%20to%20the%20initiation%20of%20treatment%20into%20multivariable%20prediction%20models%20that%20can%20generate%20individualized%20predictions%20to%20help%20clinicians%20and%20patients%20select%20the%20right%20treatment.%20With%20increasing%20availability%20of%20advanced%20statistical%20modeling%20approaches%2C%20as%20well%20as%20novel%20predictive%20variables%20and%20big%20data%2C%20treatment%20selection%20models%20promise%20to%20contribute%20to%20improved%20outcomes%20in%20depression.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20Review%20of%20Clinical%20Psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050817-084746%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%221%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22_eprint%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050817-084746%5CnPMID%3A%2029494258%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22209-236%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22Annual%20Reviews%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Treatment%20Selection%20in%20Depression%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Cohen%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Zachary%20D.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22DeRubeis%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Robert%20J.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222018%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 213</span>)</span>

 real-world contexts, two variables often influence treatment selection 
in depression. The first is client preference (McHugh et al. 2013): Many
 treatment guidelines (Hollon et al. 2014) specify the importance of 
attending to clients’ preferences. However, studies of the predictive 
utility of client preference include positive (Kocsis et al. 2009, Mergl
 et al. 2011, Swift &amp; Callahan 2009, Swift et al. 2011), mixed 
(Dunlop et al. 2017, Preference Collaborative Review Group 2008, McHugh 
et al. 2013), and negative (Dunlop et al. 2012b, Leykin et al. 2007b, 
Renjilian et al. 2001, Winter &amp; Barber 2013) findings. Seemingly, 
contrary to lay intuition, preference is not a reliable indicator of 
treatment response. What’s more, patients’ preferences might shift when 
given individualized information about expected outcomes.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FV68XN5X3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22217%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A21331%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22Mental%20health%20researchers%20and%20clinicians%20have%20long%20sought%20answers%20to%20the%20question%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20works%20for%20whom%3F%E2%80%9D%20The%20goal%20of%20precision%20medicine%20is%20to%20provide%20evidence-based%20answers%20to%20this%20question.%20Treatment%20selection%20in%20depression%20aims%20to%20help%20each%20individual%20receive%20the%20treatment%2C%20among%20the%20available%20options%2C%20that%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20lead%20to%20a%20positive%20outcome%20for%20them.%20Although%20patient%20variables%20that%20are%20predictive%20of%20response%20to%20treatment%20have%20been%20identified%2C%20this%20knowledge%20has%20not%20yet%20translated%20into%20real-world%20treatment%20recommendations.%20The%20Personalized%20Advantage%20Index%20(PAI)%20and%20related%20approaches%20combine%20information%20obtained%20prior%20to%20the%20initiation%20of%20treatment%20into%20multivariable%20prediction%20models%20that%20can%20generate%20individualized%20predictions%20to%20help%20clinicians%20and%20patients%20select%20the%20right%20treatment.%20With%20increasing%20availability%20of%20advanced%20statistical%20modeling%20approaches%2C%20as%20well%20as%20novel%20predictive%20variables%20and%20big%20data%2C%20treatment%20selection%20models%20promise%20to%20contribute%20to%20improved%20outcomes%20in%20depression.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Annual%20Review%20of%20Clinical%20Psychology%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050817-084746%22%2C%22issue%22%3A%221%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22_eprint%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1146%2Fannurev-clinpsy-050817-084746%5CnPMID%3A%2029494258%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22209-236%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22Annual%20Reviews%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Treatment%20Selection%20in%20Depression%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Cohen%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Zachary%20D.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22DeRubeis%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Robert%20J.%22%7D%5D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222018%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citation-key%22%3A%22cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 217</span>)</span></p><p><span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FYM7XT6PG%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22KUMUXMTL%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%232ea8e5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B386.395%2C540.658%2C451.85%2C549.812%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C528.706%2C451.857%2C537.86%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C516.744%2C451.884%2C525.899%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C504.792%2C451.862%2C513.947%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C492.84%2C451.88%2C501.995%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C480.879%2C451.851%2C490.033%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C468.927%2C451.879%2C478.081%5D%2C%5B87.246%2C456.974%2C451.842%2C466.129%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F40632%2Fitems%2FV68XN5X3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22217%22%7D%7D">“Prior
 exposure to ADMs and history of nonresponse to ADMs have each been 
found consistently to predict poor response to future courses of 
antidepressants (Amsterdam et al. 2009, 2016; Amsterdam &amp; Shults 
2009; Byrne &amp; Rothschild 1998). Moreover, there is evidence that the
 number of prior ADM exposures can provide prescriptive information. For
 example, Leykin et al. (2007a) found that multiple previous ADM 
exposures predicted a poorer response to ADM, but not to CT, such that a
 client with two or more prior exposures was significantly more likely 
to benefit from CT than ADM. Clearly, assessing treatment history is 
important and could be used to inform treatment selection.”</span> <span class="citation"

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There are several methods for building prediction models. The 
wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the 
researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. 
Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by 
combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a 
particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at 
least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the 
outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts
 and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic 
regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural 
networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) 
treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients
 was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was 
not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. 
AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to 
all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is 
provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic 
framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with
 fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects 
of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted 
learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the 
addiction field are discussed.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>BACKGROUND: Identifying objective and accurate markers of 
cocaine dependence (CD) can innovate its prevention and treatment. 
Existing evidence suggests that CD is characterized by a wide range of 
cognitive deficits, most notably by increased impulsivity. Impulsivity 
is multidimensional and it is unclear which of its various dimensions 
would have the highest predictive utility for CD. The machine-learning 
approach is highly promising for discovering predictive markers of 
disease. Here, we used machine learning to identify multivariate 
predictive patterns of impulsivity phenotypes that can accurately 
classify individuals with CD.
METHODS: Current cocaine-dependent users (N = 31) and healthy controls 
(N = 23) completed the self-report Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 and 
five neurocognitive tasks indexing different dimensions of impulsivity: 
(1) Immediate Memory Task (IMT), (2) Stop-Signal Task, (3) 
Delay-Discounting Task (DDT), (4) Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and (5) 
Probabilistic Reversal-Learning task. We applied a machine-learning 
algorithm to all impulsivity measures.
RESULTS: Machine learning accurately classified individuals with CD and 
predictions were generalizable to new samples (area under the curve of 
the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.912 in the test set). 
CD membership was predicted by higher scores on motor and non-planning 
trait impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and discriminability on the
 IMT, higher delay discounting on the DDT, and poor decision making on 
the IGT.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that multivariate behavioral impulsivity
 phenotypes can predict CD with high degree of accuracy, which can 
potentially be used to assess individuals' vulnerability to CD in 
clinical settings.</td>
