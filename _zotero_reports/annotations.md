## Research and training recommendations for public health data science

“Crucially, this training should highlight issues of health equity, which is at increased risk with the advent of algorithm-induced inequalities. For example, socially excluded populations are much less likely to be included in datasets used to train AI algorithms, resulting in these algorithms excluding and further marginalising these individuals.” ([Aldridge, 2019, p. e373](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/J6397ZYP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/VCARHGWW?page=1&annotation=3S954AH2)) Refer to this when discussing health equity in introduction

## Tobacco Use among Homeless People — Addressing the Neglected Addiction

“Despite the common expectation that homeless smokers may not consider cessation a priority, evidence suggests that many are interested in quitting” ([Baggett Travis P. et al., 2013, p. 202](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/NMKLHVMZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/IB34UMFX?page=2&annotation=L8NI276B)) 'amazing!

## Smoking Treatment: A Report Card on Progress and Challenges

“The three strategies reported most frequently (in overlapping categories) were giving up cigarettes at once (65.3%), gradually cutting back (62.0%), and using e-cigarettes (35.3%). Only 25% used nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) medications (e.g., nicotine patches, gum, lozenges), and only 5.4% used tobacco quitlines (free, state-sponsored, telephone-based cessation counseling services). Among individuals who used only a single quitting strategy (25.3% of the sample), the most frequently used methods were giving up cigarettes all at once (14.7%), gradually cutting back (6.6%), and substituting e-cigarettes for cigarettes (1.1%). Other methods were reported by fewer than 1% of respondents. Thus, only a small proportion of individuals use evidence-based treatments to quit smoking.” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=3&annotation=J5ZBG89W))

“a significant percentage of clinicians do not use the eReferral resources despite strong encouragement to do so (Baker et al. 2021), and their use tends to decline over time (Adsit et al. 2014, Baker et al. 2021)” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=4&annotation=C6K4WRT4)) discuss - why a tool that patients could use on their own might be beneficial rather than one exclusively available through a clinician

“A major challenge to increasing reach is that smoking has become increasingly concentrated in vulnerable populations with few resources (e.g., the severely mentally ill, the economically and educationally disadvantaged)” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=4&annotation=GWPNLNIP))

“there is evidence that allowing individuals to try various forms prior to a quit attempt allows them to find ones that they are more likely to adhere to (Cropsey et al. 2017)” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=5&annotation=Z5CGTPID))

“All of the FDA-approved medications can at least double the rate of quitting success versus placebo treatments” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=5&annotation=HZQKTBK6))

“Use of either varenicline or combination NRT produces abstinence rates about 10 percentage points higher than does nicotine gum or patch alone, as per meta-analytic estimates (i.e., 33–36% versus 24% with the patch) (Fiore et al. 2008)” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=5&annotation=YRGL7TKF))

“In sum, there is evidence that 26-week combination NRT may be more effective than standard-duration treatment in increasing long-term abstinence rates.” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=6&annotation=BLYUTLMD))

“Using self-report via ecological momentary assessment (electronic real-time assessment), researchers have repeatedly found that NRT works primarily by suppressing tobacco withdrawal symptoms, especially craving, early in the course of the quit attempt (Bolt et al. 2012, Ferguson et al. 2006). Other mechanisms have also been implicated in varenicline’s therapeutic effects; for instance, (a) it may increase the reinforcing value of nonpharmacological events, perhaps mitigating withdrawal anhedonia (Schassburger et al. 2015); (b) it reduces the salience of smoking cues and allocation of attention to them (Fedota et al. 2015), perhaps accounting for reduced cigarette craving (Brandon et al. 2011, Franklin et al. 2011); and (c)asanα4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, it appears to blunt the rewarding effects of smoking (Lu et al. 2017, West et al. 2008).” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=7&annotation=WMAII7AG))

“While numerous genetic variants have been evaluated for this purpose, the most promising basis for precision medicine is the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), which indexes nicotine metabolism and is highly influenced by variants in the CYP2A6 gene. Cross-sectional studies have shown that individuals with slower nicotine metabolism report higher quit rates with NRT compared with smokers with normal or faster nicotine metabolism (Chenoweth et al. 2016, Kaufmann et al. 2015, Schnoll et al. 2009), whereas a nonrandomized prospective study showed that varenicline was more effective than NRT for faster metabolizers (Glatard et al. 2017, Shahab et al. 2019). A prospective NMR-stratified pharmacogenetic trial (N = 1,246) (Lerman et al. 2015) characterized participants as slow or fast metabolizers of nicotine and randomized them, stratified on metabolism speed, to placebo, nicotine patch, and varenicline conditions. The results showed that faster metabolizers had significantly higher abstinence rates at follow-up if treated with varenicline versus nicotine patch. Slow metabolizers exhibited similar quit rates across the two active treatments.” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=7&annotation=ESXRJBK6))

“A second genetically informed prospective trial (Chen et al. 2020) found a genotype × treatment interaction involving the rs16969968 nicotinic receptor gene” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=7&annotation=SCHL4NQP))

“a different picture emerges in population-based studies that have retrospectively gathered data on smoking status and quit methods. These studies have yielded mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of smoking medication in real-world use.” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=8&annotation=M3VEE3YK))

“smoking medications may not be effective when used in real-world circumstances in which individuals make use decisions on their own and receive little or no additional support in their quit attempts.” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=8&annotation=ETAJUSIL))

“The challenge in this area for researchers is twofold: (a) to gain greater insight into the causes of the apparent weak effects of medication in real-world use, and (b) to devise low-burden, highly disseminable methods that will provide greater support for real-world medication use. Digital interventions might serve the latter purpose (Tindle & Greevy 2018).” ([Baker and McCarthy, 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/2G4XVT3S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/PG8ZBN46?page=9&annotation=EMQIFQS4))

## Predictors of smoking cessation outcomes identified by machine learning: A systematic review

“Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States (US), contributing to approximately a half million deaths annually, including nearly 30% of all cancer deaths” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=1&annotation=LPF2ACT7))

“substantial health and loss-of-productivity costs, exceeding 300 billion US dollars annually” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=2&annotation=8BZGFUHR))

“Biomarkers(n = 2 studies; [10,15]), included exhaled carbon monoxide or neuroimaging (i.e., anatomical and functional) as the predictors. Economic,environmental, andsociodemographic(n = 9 studies; [11–19]), included variables such as gender, race, household income, number of individuals that smoke in the household, and cigarette availability. Engagement(n = 3 studies; [11,16,20]) included user response rate and attendance predictors. Neurocognitive(n = 1 study; [21]), included measures such as executive functioning (e.g., delay discounting), memory, and attention as predictors. Physicalhealth-related(n = 7 studies; [12–18]) included predictors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, and hypertension. Psychological(n = 9 studies; [1115,17–19,21]) included predictors such as motivation, self-efficacy, affect, and perceived stress. Finally, Smokingseverityandhistory(n = 8 studies; [11,13,15–19,21]) included indicators of nicotine dependence (e.g., the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence; formerly known as Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; [22]), age of smoking initiation, and quantity of consumption.” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=5&annotation=5F6689H7))

“delay discounting, the reduction in reward value as a function of delay to receipt [21], having individuals who smoke daily” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=5&annotation=KY4HXY4F))

“at home [16], attendance in smoking cessation education [16], more positive experiences (measured by the Vaping Experiences Score) [17], higher perceived odds of smoking today [14], increased confidence to avoid smoking [14], the belief that medication is dangerous [18], scores on the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives [WISDM; 23] (i.e., cognitive enhancement, primary dependence, and taste/sensory properties) [18], parent ethnicity [11], smoking intervals [11], boredom [11], male sex[11], consumption during intervention commencement [20], engagement [20], irritability [12], cigarette availability [12], exposure to individuals who smoke [12], smoking restrictions [12], recent alcohol consumption [12], resting state brain networks [10], and motivation [19] and education level [19]. Together, these predictors identified by this review comprised all seven categories mentioned above.” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=6&annotation=FTQE9PG6))

“A major limitation of this area of research is the paucity of inclusion of the neurobehavioral mechanisms underpinning smoking-related decision-making. The competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) theory postulates addiction in part arises from an imbalance in the executive and impulsive decision-making systems [53,54]. Delay discounting has been identified as an index of CNDS balance where individuals with higher delay discounting rates display hyperactivation in impulsive neural systems (e.g., limbic system regions) and hypoactivation of executive regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) [55]. Therefore, the inclusion of delay discounting and, perhaps, other neurocognitive decisionmaking constructs within machine learning and smoking cessation is a future direction that could identify novel therapeutic targets” ([Bickel et al., 2023, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GFKY3FDP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/I5QC2YCP?page=8&annotation=4YBC37DQ))

## Quit Methods Used by US Adult Cigarette Smokers, 2014–2016

“Quitting cigarette smoking greatly reduces the risk of developing smoking-related diseases; although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, there are benefits at any age (1).” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=1&annotation=ETF7GFSC))

“Our analysis was based on 15,943 current cigarette smokers who reported having made at least one quit attempt in the previous 3 months.” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=1&annotation=W8YM495Q))

“Overall, 74.7% of adult current cigarette smokers used multiple quit methods during their most recent quit attempt” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=2&annotation=N6Q6G9ZM))

“Giving up cigarettes all at once (65.3%) and gradually cutting back on cigarettes (62.0%) were the most commonly used methods to try to quit, followed by substituting some cigarettes with e-cigarettes (35.3%), using a nicotine patch or gum (25.4%), switching completely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes (24.7%), and switching from “regular” cigarettes to “mild” cigarettes (20.4%). Quit methods used less often were getting help from a doctor or other health professional (15.2%), using smoking cessation medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (12.2%), and getting help from a website (7.1%) or a telephone quitline (5.4%).” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=2&annotation=VLKIBLT4))

“25.3% reported using only one method to quit cigarettes during their most recent quit attempt” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=2&annotation=8XPP2PZV))

“The single most common quit method used alone was giving up cigarettes all at once (14.7%), followed by gradually cutting back on cigarettes (6.6%)” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=2&annotation=2CT6FN56))

“Giving up cigarettes all at once (“cold turkey”) and gradually cutting back on cigarettes continue to be the most commonly used methods” ([Caraballo, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/74QUZPJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/A5VGGDUS?page=2&annotation=V86PK5T7))

## Estimating the number of quit attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully in a longitudinal cohort of smokers

“Knowing how many quit attempts it takes an average smoker to quit is important as it can frame different narratives about the quitting process. This information can be used to inform smoking cessation advice and important messages to stay engaged in the process of quitting.” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=1&annotation=IKH4AMCX))

“suggests that the successful quitter reports an average of 6.3 (SD: 1.4) lifetime quit attempts. Successful daily smokers reported a mean of 6.8 (SD: 1.6) lifetime attempts, while successful occasional smokers reported a mean of 4.7 (SD: 0.6) lifetime attempts” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=GALPI8MQ))

“the expected average number of quit attempts before quitting successfully would be 20.4 quit attempts for daily smokers and 16.7 attempts for occasional smokers” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=KN93DN2V))

“Using this distribution of quit attempts in the life table analysis, we found that the average number of quit attempts expected in order to succeed was 29.6 (95% CI 27.6 to 31.6) attempts” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=RJQCT4HB))

“When the lifetime number of recalled quit attempts were included to the probability of quitting on a given quit attempt, the likelihood for success peaks on the fourth to sixth attempt” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=MJKPUSZ6))

“Using this distribution of probability of quitting per quit attempt using the life table approach, the mean number of attempts was 142.0 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.2); daily smokers had a mean of 142.3 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.9), while occasional smokers had a mean of 21.0 (95% CI 18.3 to 23.7” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=S3MVUU93))

“Under what we consider to be the best set of assumptions (Method 3: Life Table, Observed Quit Rates), this study suggests that a current smoker tries to quit on average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer.” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=5&annotation=S4L323NE))

“Despite a high number of quit attempts needed to quit was found on average in this study, many individual smokers are able to quit successfully on relatively few attempts.21 Ashley et al22 suggested that between 40% and 52% of former smokers quit the first time they make a serious attempt to do so. This is consistent with the assumption that quit attempts are not independent—those who have difficulty quitting will need to make many more quit attempts to succeed than those who have less difficulty. While many people may be able to quit smoking on the first few attempts, others may not be able to quit after hundreds of attempts. Efforts can also be taken by individuals to improve their chances of success, such as using quit aids, or receiving counselling.” ([Chaiton et al., 2016, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/D38XPMLV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/BKK7IXFW?page=7&annotation=H6WZCDD8))

## Genetic Variant in CHRNA5 and Response to Varenicline and Combination Nicotine Replacement in a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial

“The primary end point was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT, week 12)” ([Chen et al., 2020, p. 1315](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/QP9N8B6Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W89QVIYM?page=1&annotation=C34M2XNU)) add into inclusion of multiple time points for aim 2 analyses - PMH studies (e.g., Chen et al.) have used EOT as a primary outcome

“In African American smokers, there was a genotype-by-treatment interaction for EOT abstinence (χ 2 = 10.7, degrees of freedom = 2. P = 0.0049): specifically, cNRT was more effective in smokers with rs16969968 GG genotype than was placebo, while varenicline was more effective in smokers of GA/AA genotypes. In EA ancestry smokers, there was no significant genotype-by-treatment interaction.” ([Chen et al., 2020, p. 1315](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/QP9N8B6Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W89QVIYM?page=1&annotation=5ZHEVVN3))

“differential treatment response by CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotypes for smokers of African American ancestry, but not for smokers of EA. Among African American smokers, cNRT is more effective in smokers with GG genotypes, whereas varenicline is more effective for smokers with G A /A A genot y pes.” ([Chen et al., 2020, p. 1315](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/QP9N8B6Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W89QVIYM?page=1&annotation=XXPXZBUJ))

“The risk, prevalence, and mortality from smoking-related diseases are disproportionately higher for African American smokers than for EA smokers, and these findings enhance our ability to improve smoking treatment effectiveness for African American smokers.” ([Chen et al., 2020, p. 1315](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/QP9N8B6Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W89QVIYM?page=1&annotation=68SI7D54))

## Pathways to precision medicine in smoking cessation treatments

“Leveraging advances in genomics and data science, the goal of precision medicine is to tailor treatments based on an individual’s unique characteristics to maximize benefits and minimize side effects [11]. Growing research in understanding human genomes and identifying specific genetic markers for a disease will not only lead to improved understanding of the biology underlying the disease, but also improved clinical care.” ([Chen et al., 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/HS7PTMBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/32ZBFQ3Y?page=2&annotation=WU9UTPRZ)) can cite this paper in list of citations re: rise of genetic methods --> PM

“Growing evidence suggests that CHRNA5predicts response to cessation pharmacotherapy.” ([Chen et al., 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/HS7PTMBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/32ZBFQ3Y?page=6&annotation=Q5H9J932))

“Chen, Bloom, and colleagues showed that CYP2A6-defined nicotine metabolic function moderated the effect of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy on smoking relapse with pharmacotherapy significantly slowing relapse in fast, but not slow, metabolizers. Nicotine replacement therapy was effective amongst individuals with fast, but not slow, CYP2A6-defined nicotine metabolism. In contrast, the effect of bupropion on relapse likelihood was unlikely affected by nicotine metabolism as estimated from CYP2A6genotype [56].” ([Chen et al., 2018, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/HS7PTMBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/32ZBFQ3Y?page=8&annotation=P8WZX92L))

“Despite growing evidence of genetic markers as predictor of prognosis and treatment response, translation into clinical practice requires much work due to many factors such as inconsistent evidence, little data in diverse ancestry populations, lack of available CLIAcertified fast genotyping for clinical use, and need for research on cost-effectiveness [2, 14, 17, 44, 54, 114, 115] . To implement precision medicine for smoking cessation treatment, there are potential barriers. Some people remain skeptical for the value of genetic testing while proven interventions for treating tobacco dependence, including simple cost-effective measures, such as quit lines which are underutilized [116]. Furthermore, whether the use of personalized genomic information can be used to promote behavior change remains a topic of debate [117].” ([Chen et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/HS7PTMBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/32ZBFQ3Y?page=9&annotation=3WJZ3VJZ))

## The Nicotine Metabolite Ratio is Associated With Early Smoking Abstinence Even After Controlling for Factors That Influence the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio

“Lower NMR (<0.31) was associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence (OR  =  1.43; 95% CI  =  1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, alcohol, and cigarette consumption.” ([Chenoweth et al., 2016, p. 491](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/A859WLEG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/JI8ISKG3?page=1&annotation=F79Y33HI))

“The baseline NMR was assessed from blood while participants were smoking as usual, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry” ([Chenoweth et al., 2016, p. 492](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/A859WLEG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/JI8ISKG3?page=2&annotation=QMQ49JNB))

“ompared to normal metabolizers, slow metabolizers were significantly more likely to achieve abstinence” ([Chenoweth et al., 2016, p. 492](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/A859WLEG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/JI8ISKG3?page=2&annotation=8VKTQUJB))

“The association between slow metabolism and increased abstinence likelihood did not change (OR = 1.32; P = .022) when we controlled for treatment.” ([Chenoweth et al., 2016, p. 492](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/A859WLEG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/JI8ISKG3?page=2&annotation=BSUE4X7J))

## Treatment Selection in Depression

“Treatment selection in depression aims to help each individual receive the treatment, among the available options, that is most likely to lead to a positive outcome for them.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 209](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=1&annotation=NB89M6KI))

“In recent years, researchers have developed and tested the utility of multivariable prediction models to address the “What works for whom?” question. The promise of this work lies in the ability of such models to integrate multiple sources of information, rather than to rely on a single feature to inform treatment selection.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 210](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=2&annotation=WAUA8SXF))

“Precision medicine1 has afforded major advances in cancer treatment (National Research Council 2011, Schwaederle et al. 2015). For example, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Early trials of the drugs erlotinib and gefitinib found little to no benefit of these drugs alone or in combination with chemotherapy (Pao & Miller 2005). However, recent clinical trials have found significantly improved outcomes for these drugs, relative to chemotherapy, in a specific subset of NSCLC patients with tumor mutations linked to the mechanisms of action of erlotinib and gefitinib (Paez et al. 2004, Rosell et al. 2012).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 211](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=3&annotation=ZRE3L2Y6)) advances in cancer precision medicine

“Prescriptive variables, often referred to as moderators, affect the direction or strength of the differences in outcome between two or more treatments (Baron & Kenny 1986), and thus can help predict whether a patient will benefit more from one treatment relative to another.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 211](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=3&annotation=EF7PVEYC))

“A variable is prognostic if it predicts response in a single treatment, or irrespective of treatment condition. If only one intervention is being analyzed, only prognostic relationships can be inferred.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 211](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=3&annotation=8JC6R5FG))

“As defined by a National Research Council report, precision medicine “refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. It does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not. Although the term ‘personalized medicine’ is also used to convey this meaning, that term is sometimes misinterpreted as implying that unique treatments can be designed for each individual” (National Research Council 2011, p. 125).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 211](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=3&annotation=VWFZ539C))

“Therapists select treatments for patients as a matter of course in every day practice. A clinician who attends to information about a specific client’s presentation will likely generate hypotheses about the client’s expected responses to potentially available treatments (Lorenzo-Luaces et al. 2015). These predictions may draw on a variety of sources, including a clinician’s history with clients with similar features, their experiences in training and supervision, reasoning based on theory, and the empirical literature on treatment response (Raza & Holohan 2015). However, there is limited empirical literature to guide personalized, or precision, selection of treatments. Clinicians are therefore forced to practice what Perlis (2016) has dubbed “artisanal medicine.” Artisanal medicine is the practice of making treatment decisions in an idiosyncratic or unsystematic manner, or in a manner guided by theory and experience but largely uninformed by empirical evidence or feedback. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization that defines artisanal medicine limits the validity and utility of such approaches for decision making” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 213](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=5&annotation=AHWWJJ5S)) expanded way of describing "traditional tx selection" as i currently have in intro. maybe gives more credit to clinicians so worth incorporating

“The average treatment effect (ATE) is the extent to which, for the clients in the sample, a given intervention leads to more (or less) symptom improvement, on average, relative to comparator conditions. The main findings from RCTs refer to effects of treatments, on average, and not to potentially important sources of variability in treatment response” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 213](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=5&annotation=4HPBC3RG))

“In real-world contexts, two variables often influence treatment selection in depression. The first is client preference (McHugh et al. 2013): Many treatment guidelines (Hollon et al. 2014) specify the importance of attending to clients’ preferences. However, studies of the predictive utility of client preference include positive (Kocsis et al. 2009, Mergl et al. 2011, Swift & Callahan 2009, Swift et al. 2011), mixed (Dunlop et al. 2017, Preference Collaborative Review Group 2008, McHugh et al. 2013), and negative (Dunlop et al. 2012b, Leykin et al. 2007b, Renjilian et al. 2001, Winter & Barber 2013) findings. Seemingly, contrary to lay intuition, preference is not a reliable indicator of treatment response. What’s more, patients’ preferences might shift when given individualized information about expected outcomes.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 217](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=9&annotation=XBEMJUYR))

“Prior exposure to ADMs and history of nonresponse to ADMs have each been found consistently to predict poor response to future courses of antidepressants (Amsterdam et al. 2009, 2016; Amsterdam & Shults 2009; Byrne & Rothschild 1998). Moreover, there is evidence that the number of prior ADM exposures can provide prescriptive information. For example, Leykin et al. (2007a) found that multiple previous ADM exposures predicted a poorer response to ADM, but not to CT, such that a client with two or more prior exposures was significantly more likely to benefit from CT than ADM. Clearly, assessing treatment history is important and could be used to inform treatment selection.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 217](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=9&annotation=KUMUXMTL)) add this to discussion of other dx have shown differential tx response in craig's part of the intro

“This posed a challenge for selecting treatments for patients with contradicting indications.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 217](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=9&annotation=NP48H37P)) If we rely on "single" moderators/predictors, they may be contraindicated (eg one suggests one treatment, one suggests another). Considering them in aggregate from the start allows for a single recommendation

“We also reasoned that effective guidance for clinicians and clients would, ideally, be “graded,” to reflect the likelihood that for some clients differential benefit would be expected to be quite substantial, for others it would be negligible, and for others in between.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 218](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=10&annotation=55I6KU9N))

“To generate the prediction for treatment A, the client’s values on the baseline variables, as well as the value representing treatment A, are inserted into the model. This is repeated, with the value of treatment B inserted into the model. The predicted value with treatment A in the model is compared with the predicted value under treatment B. The sign of the difference reflects the model-indicated treatment, and the magnitude of the difference reflects the magnitude, or strength, of the predicted difference.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 218](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=10&annotation=VK5NF9YS)) THIS IS WHAT I AM DOING TOO YAY. also consider looking into probability "gap" between best and second/worst tx?

“Multivariable models are more likely to yield powerful predictions (Perlis 2013), and they comport with our understanding of psychopathology and treatment response as complex, multiply determined phenomena (Drysdale et al. 2017). Unfortunately, the interpretation and application of multivariable models is less straightforward for the clinician than are single-variable approaches.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 219](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=11&annotation=WG9LJ6B8))

“As new, more powerful modeling approaches become available (Kapelner & Bleich 2016, Luedtke & van der Laan 2016, Ma et al. 2016), researchers must weigh the increased flexibility and predictive power of such approaches against the interpretability (Hastie et al. 2009, James et al. 2013) of simpler models (Green & Armstrong 2015), especially insofar as the goal is to disseminate the models in ways that are acceptable to clinicians and clients (Delgadillo et al. 2016).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 219](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=11&annotation=PK78YQBJ))

“It is understandable that more progress has been made to date with prognostic models, relative to prescriptive models, but the former have less relevance to a core question in mental health treatment: “Which treatment should client X pursue to have the greatest likelihood of having a positive outcome?”” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 219](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=11&annotation=9RXZ2SIH)) this is the gist of many sud "PMH" studies to date, saying they are pmh but really just identifying prognostic models/factors that are ultimately unhelpful for SELECTING a treatment

“The past half-decade has witnessed a surge of interest in optimizing treatment selection using multivariable predictive models, and much of this work is focused on treatments for depression.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 220](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=12&annotation=FNGB6LCC))

“When the same dataset is used both to generate the model and to test its utility, special care must be taken to avoid a situation in which the model is fit specifically to the sample and is therefore unlikely to generalize in an independent application (Ioannidis 2005, Open Science Collaboration 2015).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 225](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=17&annotation=54MQXINX))

“In the context of equivalent average outcomes for the two treatments, if the average response of those who receive their indicated treatment is (statistically significantly) superior to the average response of those who receive their nonindicated treatment, this can be taken as evidence that the model has predictive power.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 225](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=17&annotation=5BRJPSZS))

“A recommendation that treatment A is to be preferred over treatment B could arise from a PAI that is very large, in which case a clinician might strongly advise a client to pursue treatment A. However, if the predicted advantage is so small as to be clinically meaningless (e.g., a PAI close to zero), then the clinician would communicate this information to the client, and other factors would play a larger role in selecting treatment.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 226](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=18&annotation=WYL73KLZ))

“Intelligent allocation of limited or costly resources has relevance for any class of treatment, including psychotherapy—the availability of which is often limited by the availability of trained clinicians—and pharmacotherapy, in which associated risks should be minimized.” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 226](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=18&annotation=ZXLKKNW5))

“Work with single features has been attractive in part due to its simplicity, and because of the ease with which a theory-based interpretation can be applied to the findings to support or understand the resulting recommendations. Unfortunately, the vast majority of this research on individual differences in treatment response (e.g., project MATCH; Allen et al. 1997) has failed to have a meaningful impact on client care (Simon & Perlis 2010).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 226](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=18&annotation=WSMN3QLR))

“Modern multivariable treatment selection approaches can overcome many of the shortcomings that have hindered progress and therefore hold great promise for the future of precision mental health. Part of this future will require a resolution of the tension between the statistical methodology of explanatory approaches that have dominated psychology and the predictive approaches the will power precision medicine going forward (Yarkoni & Westfall 2017).” ([Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018, p. 227](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/V68XN5X3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/YM7XT6PG?page=19&annotation=PSUD5U9S))

## Optimization of Behavioral, Biobehavioral, and Biomedical Interventions: The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)

“Interactions can be estimated when other link functions are used, such as the logistic, but the interpretation of the results is more complicated and requires particularly careful consideration (e.g., Karaca-Mandic, Norton, & Dowd, 2012). It is important to note that any main effect or interaction that is significant when one link function is used may or may not be significant when a different link function is used. Linear transformations of variables do not affect the interpretation of effects and associated hypothesis tests in an ANOVA, but nonlinear transformations, such as squaring or log transformations, do affect the interpretation of both main effects and interactions, as well as tests of hypotheses involving these effects.” ([Collins, 2018, p. 116](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GC22MBSK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/ZURXW5UC?page=143&annotation=LQW87BLT))

## Tobacco Product Use Among Adults — United States, 2019

“The prevalence of any current tobacco product use was higher among males; adults aged ≤65 years; non-Hispanic American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults; those whose highest level of educational attainment was a General Educational Development (GED) certificate; those with an annual household income <$35,000; lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) adults; uninsured adults and those with Medicaid; those with a disability; or those with mild, moderate, or severe generalized anxiety disorder.” ([Cornelius, 2020, p. 1736](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/Z876HY8Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/INWZSG3N?page=1&annotation=9DNJUF8A))

“among those living in the Midwest (23.7%) or South (22.9%) than among those in the Northeast (18.5%) or West (16.4%)” ([Cornelius, 2020, p. 1737](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/Z876HY8Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/INWZSG3N?page=2&annotation=YC5QMINW))

“Prevalence was also higher among adults who were uninsured (30.2%), insured by Medicaid (30.0%), or had some other public insurance (25.6%) than among those with private insurance (18.0%) or Medicare only (11.4%)” ([Cornelius, 2020, p. 1737](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/Z876HY8Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/INWZSG3N?page=2&annotation=ERARN2I3))

## A Machine-Learning Approach to Predicting Smoking Cessation Treatment Outcomes

“evidence-based treatment for tobacco use greatly improves the likelihood that smokers achieve abstinence, more than two-thirds of individuals relapse when provided even the most robust treatments” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 415](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=1&annotation=S5IJ2X68))

“Identifying for whom treatment is most effective will improve the overall success of our tobacco treatments and perhaps identify strategies for improving current approaches” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 415](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=1&annotation=U7WPSDPQ)) I disagree with this. Conflating prognostic and prescriptive predictors. Knowing who treatment works for doesn't help us... it would just mean we'd only give treatments to some people?

“In contrast to multivariate logistic regression that considers all parameters at once when making predictions, CART is uniquely suited to generate clinical decision tools because it provides a decision tree with specific parameters and cutoffs for each clinical choice.” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 418](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=4&annotation=9A4PIT3S)) disagree (not that trees can be good decision tools, but that logistic regression can't be)

“Delay Discounting Task provides the most predictive power for identifying smoking abstinence.” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 419](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=5&annotation=CQFGEUP3))

“The decision trees ubiquitously identified delay discounting rate as the first split for identifying treatment responders versus nonresponders. This finding is consistent with previous work showing that delay discounting is predictive of treatment outcomes in adolescent marijuana users,(29) cocaine users,(30) and cigarette smokers.(31,32)” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 420](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=6&annotation=FAWWH7AW))

“This finding adds to prior work identifying ways to use delay discounting to inform clinical practice and is consistent with suggestions that it be considered a marker of addiction processes.” ([Coughlin et al., 2020, p. 421](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/GWW3RQ9C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/US2TI9KL?page=7&annotation=6SBQH7ZK))

## The Personalized Advantage Index: translating research on prediction into individualized treatment recommendations. A demonstration

“Published reports of prescriptive relationships tend to be limited to examinations of single pre-treatment variables or of multiple variables that are each considered in isolation.” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=1&annotation=G7X5BQ2N))

“The methods we describe produce point predictions of symptom severity at post-treatment for each individual in each of two interventions. The comparison of the two estimates yields an index, which we call the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI). The PAI identifies the treatment predicted to produce the better outcome for a given patient, and it provides the patient with a quantitative estimate of the magnitude by which that treatment is predicted to outperform the other. The utility of the approach is then tested by comparing the outcomes of those who had been randomly assigned to their indicated treatment versus those assigned to their non-indicated treatment.” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=2&annotation=GS2FGYNG)) reference for clinical evaluation methods!!!

“Because each model is estimated absent any information about the patient whose scores are to be predicted, the predictions are considered to contain little or no bias [25]. In essence, the accuracy of the set of predictions is what would be expected if the procedure had been used to predict outcomes in another set of patients who were drawn randomly from the same population of patients, assuming they would be assigned to the same treatments in the same way (i.e., randomly) [27].” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=3&annotation=2YQWJ76P)) wondering if i need to/should have done this? might be problematic with glmnet because it could choose different variables?

“the magnitude of the predicted difference, for each patient, of receiving the treatment with the greater predicted benefit (Optimal) versus the other (Non-optimal) treatment. This last value is an index of ‘‘predicted advantage’’ which we call the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI).” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=3&annotation=93DS46LJ))

“As can be seen, whereas for some patients the predicted advantage of being assigned to their Optimal treatment was large, for others it was very small. For 62 (40%) of the patients, the PAI did not meet the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criterion (three points on the HRSD) for a ‘‘clinically significant’’ difference. For such patients, little weight would be given to the model’s predictions in a treatment selection decision; other factors (e.g., cost or patient preference) would likely be used to guide treatment. We test our approach, therefore, using the full sample of 154 patients as well as a reduced sample of those 92 patients (60%) whose PAI was ‘‘clinically significant.’’” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=4&annotation=9UW3B8HR))

“A true prospective test of our approach would begin with a randomized trial of two interventions. A predictive model, as we have described here, would be derived from the data obtained during the randomized trial. The model would then be tested in sample of patients who seek treatment in the same clinic in which the randomized trial was performed, using the same treatments. Outcomes of patients who are randomized to one of two conditions would then be compared: (a) those whose treatment is determined by random assignment, as in the first phase of the study; versus (b) those whose assignment is determined by the output of the predictive algorithm that was generated in the first phase.” ([DeRubeis et al., 2014, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/JXWUUKQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/XERXFMBD?page=5&annotation=EANNC539))

## Predicting smoking cessation, reduction and relapse six months after using the Stop-Tabac app for smartphones: a machine learning analysis

“moking cessation after 6 months was predicted by the following factors (in this order): tobacco dependence, motivation to quit smoking, frequency of app use and its perceived usefulness, and nicotine medication use. Among those who were still smoking at follow-up, reduction in cigarettes/day was predicted by tobacco dependence, nicotine medication use, frequency of app use and its perceived usefulness, and e-cigarette use. Among those who had quit smoking after one month, relapse after six months was predicted by intention to quit, frequency of app use, perceived usefulness of the app, level of dependence and nicotine medication use.” ([Etter et al., 2023, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/CPUJ3VFV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/62HME4NB?page=1&annotation=EMJC8GEK))

## Association of nicotine metabolism and sex with relapse following varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy

“In the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping and in women, the hazard ratio for relapsing was significantly lower with varenicline for a partial decrease (HR=0.33, 95%CI=[0.12-0.89] and HR=0.20, 95%CI=[0.040.91], respectively) and non-significantly lower for a total cessation (HR=0.45, 95%CI=[0.20-1.0] and HR=0.38, 95%CI=[0.14-1.0]). When compared to the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping, the hazard ratio for a partial decrease was similar in the normal metabolizers determined by genotyping (HR=0.42, 95%CI=[0.18-0.94]) while it was significantly lower with varenicline for a total cessation (HR=0.50, 95%CI=[0.26-0.98]). Women and normal nicotine metabolizers may benefit more from varenicline over nicotine replacement therapy.” ([Glatard et al., 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/7IDXGWZ4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/M5BHTALU?page=4&annotation=JMA8EVYE))

## Natural History of Attempts to Stop Smoking

“Most smokers (60%) made multiple transitions among smoking, reduction, and abstinence. Intention to not smoke or quit often did not result in a quit attempt but were still strong predictors of a quit attempt and eventual abstinence. Most quit attempts (79%) lasted less than 1 day; about one fifth (18%) of the participants were abstinent at 12 weeks. The majority of quit attempts (72%) were not preceded by an intention to quit. Such quit attempts were shorter than quit attempts preceded by an intention to quit (<1 day vs. 25 days). Most smokers (67%) used a treatment, and use of a treatment was nonsignificantly associated with greater abstinence (14 days vs. 3 days). Making a quit attempt and failing early predicted an increased probability of a later quit attempt compared to not making a quit attempt early (86% vs. 67%). Smokers often (17%) failed to report brief quit attempts on an end-of-study survey.” ([Hughes et al., 2014, p. 1190](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8HKMCUK8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/8KXMLZ2H?page=1&annotation=FITA3PI2))

## Machine learning application for predicting smoking cessation among US adults: An analysis of waves 1-3 of the PATH study

“Although most cigarette users want to quit smoking, and more than half of current smokers make aquit attempt every year, less than 10% remain abstinent for at least six months [9]. Identifying the factors driving and sustaining smoking cessation isthus a critical need to address this epidemic effectively.” ([Issabakhsh et al., 2023, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78ZS8DC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/K4KQPVPF?page=2&annotation=BXLNUYTG)) remember to make the point in intro when talking about other ml/pmh research that there ARE reasons that it’s important to predict smoking cessation (help to understand driving factors, learn about what factors maintain smoking/predict success/etc., help identify intervention/prevention/policy targets) --> just not the same as PMH. and doesn’t automatically lead to PMH like many studies claim

“Only individuals with an intention to quit participate in such programs, which limits the generalizability of the results.” ([Issabakhsh et al., 2023, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78ZS8DC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/K4KQPVPF?page=2&annotation=438EKH5E)) not true in my case because this is to develop an algorithm for people wanting to select among treatments, so they do already have an interest in quitting

“The sample was then divided into atraining (70%) and atesting (30%) dataset” ([Issabakhsh et al., 2023, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78ZS8DC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/K4KQPVPF?page=5&annotation=D3LJ7SAW)) only one split. they did use an additional validation sample (from a later wave), but generally less rigorous resampling here

“out of 67 variables detected significant by GBM, 11 variables (16%) correspond to individual’s cigarette smoking history and cigarette use habits in wave 1, 11 (16%) are variables related to tobacco products use (other than cigarettes and e-cigarettes) in waves 1and 2, 10 (15%) are physical and mental health and quality of life variables in wave 1, 9(13%) are demographics and socio-economic status (SES) variables in wave 1, 7(10%) are variables related to family and friends tobacco products use habits and rules about tobacco products use at home in wave 1, 5(8%) are variables related to knowledge and beliefs about smoking and tobacco products harmfulness in wave 1, 4(6%) are variables related to the exposure to tobacco ads and promotions in wave 1, 3(5%) are alcohol and other substances use variables in wave 1, 3(5%) are variables related to noticing tobacco products health warnings in wave 1, 2(3%) are ecigarette use variables in waves 1and 2, and 2(3%) are variables related to social media exposure in wave 1.” ([Issabakhsh et al., 2023, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78ZS8DC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/K4KQPVPF?page=6&annotation=SESXMKPV))

“7(4%) are e-cigarette use variables in waves 1and 2, 7(4%) are variables related to family and friends tobacco products use habits and rules about tobacco products use at home in wave 1” ([Issabakhsh et al., 2023, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78ZS8DC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/K4KQPVPF?page=8&annotation=VWQAT5EZ))

“We selected the combination of the top 25 variables detected significant by both GBM and RF algorithms shown in Table 1to develop our final model to predict smoking cessation for participants in wave 2.

## Current cigarette smoking among adults - United States, 2005-2014

“The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 16.8% in 2014.” ([Jamal et al., 2015, p. 1233](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/FMCWSRSF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4UU63TZ8?page=1&annotation=VJIGTYS8))

“Overall in 2014, higher smoking prevalences were reported among persons insured by Medicaid only (29.1%; 5.5 million) and persons who were uninsured (27.9%; 8.8 million) than among persons insured by private health insurance (12.9%; 19.6 million) or Medicare only (12.5%; 2.3 million).” ([Jamal et al., 2015, p. 1237](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/FMCWSRSF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4UU63TZ8?page=5&annotation=MZJI7N2L))

## 21st-Century Hazards of Smoking and Benefits of Cessation in the United States

“For participants who were 25 to 79 years of age, the rate of death from any cause among current smokers was about three times that among those who had never smoked” ([Jha Prabhat et al., 2013, p. 341](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/DTXN9DKU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/9ZTZ25NY?page=1&annotation=9NAQL7YY))

“The probability of surviving from 25 to 79 years of age was about twice as great in those who had never smoked as in current smokers (70% vs. 38% among women and 61% vs. 26% among men)” ([Jha Prabhat et al., 2013, p. 341](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/DTXN9DKU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/9ZTZ25NY?page=1&annotation=4UWJFP8B))

“Life expectancy was shortened by more than 10 years among the current smokers, as compared with those who had never smoked. Adults who had quit smoking at 25 to 34, 35 to 44, or 45 to 54 years of age gained about 10, 9, and 6 years of life, respectively, as compared with those who continued to smoke.” ([Jha Prabhat et al., 2013, p. 341](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/DTXN9DKU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/9ZTZ25NY?page=1&annotation=U8623FE2))

“Smokers lose at least one decade of life expectancy, as compared with those who have never smoked. Cessation before the age of 40 years reduces the risk of death associated with continued smoking by about 90%.” ([Jha Prabhat et al., 2013, p. 341](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/DTXN9DKU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/9ZTZ25NY?page=1&annotation=EBUAJRY4))

## On the use of cross-validation to assess performance in multivariate prediction

“Two-deep internal assessment provides reasonable estimates of predictive performance for all cases except when n is much smaller than p.” ([Jonathan et al., 2000, p. 217](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/7U3QG5G3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4VH6EZC9?page=9&annotation=88BX2ITX))

## Interaction Terms in Nonlinear Models

“In contrast to a linear model (equation 3), the marginal effect of an explanatory variable in a nonlinear model is not constant over its entire range, even in the absence of interaction terms (i.e., b12 = 0)” ([Karaca-Mandic et al., 2012, p. 258](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/3MPZNC2D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4MG9FKY2?page=4&annotation=AEV68ZVS))

[image] ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4MG9FKY2?page=5&annotation=26VDWKMI))  
([Karaca-Mandic et al., 2012, p. 259](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/3MPZNC2D))

“The addition of a binary explanatory variable like female to the logit or probit model (as shown on the right‐hand side of equation 2) shifts the S‐shaped curve (see Figure 2b). The marginal effect of age for a 20 year old now depends on the individual's sex, even though there is no interaction term in the model. Adding an interaction term to the model (corresponding to the righthand side of equation 3) yields the relationships shown in Figure 2c. When all the coefficients are positive, the effect of adding the interaction term is to make the curve for women more steeply sloped in the middle range of age. As in Figure 2b with no explicit interaction term, the marginal effect of age is different for different values of age and for different values of female.” ([Karaca-Mandic et al., 2012, p. 260](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/3MPZNC2D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4MG9FKY2?page=6&annotation=XBKRJB5F))

“An additional feature of nonlinear models is the need to understand the distinction between the scale of interest and the scale of estimation. Some typical examples of the scale of interest in health services research include expenditures, and out‐of‐pocket costs in dollar amounts; utilization of health care services measured as inpatient, outpatient, emergency department visits, length of hospital stays; as well as probability of various outcomes such as any health care spending, any doctor visits, and indicators of unmet needs or other access to care measures. The scale of estimation, on the other hand, could be log transformation of the outcome variable when it is a continuous variable, or a nonlinear transformation of the probability that the outcome equals 1 (e.g., logit or probit of the probability) when the outcome is binary.” ([Karaca-Mandic et al., 2012, p. 261](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/3MPZNC2D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/4MG9FKY2?page=7&annotation=UY4MZYMB))

## Rate of Nicotine Metabolism and Smoking Cessation Outcomes in a Community-based Sample of Treatment-Seeking Smokers

“The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR = .58, 95% CI: 0.35-0.98, p = .04), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates than slower metabolizers (24% vs. 33%).” ([Kaufmann et al., 2015, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/9K7849TP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/DHLMUGLH?page=2&annotation=B3BWFXDD))

## Development of Machine Learning Models for Prediction of Smoking Cessation Outcome

“the ANN model had the best accuracy of 0.640 and an ROC value of 0.660 (95% CI: 0.617–0.702). The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model was 0.704 and 0.567 respectively. As a result, the ANN model was adopted as the desired model for smoking cessation clinic setting in the study.” ([Lai et al., 2021, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/BFCW3EWN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/IDL2DMBK?page=5&annotation=7HJ2P24C))

“A predicted success rate could be provided for each patient, which could aid in shared decision making with the patient. Moreover, this method also had the potential to achieve personalized and precision medicine for treatment of smoking cessation.” ([Lai et al., 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/BFCW3EWN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/IDL2DMBK?page=9&annotation=26Z8VJ3H)) prognostic model (predicting success of cessation) does not necessarily translate to a treatment selection model. unclear here if tx was allowed to interact with other features. this model does step 1 but is not yet ready to be applied for pmh goals (and can't just claim that it is!)

## Initiating Pharmacologic Treatment in Tobacco-Dependent Adults. An Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline

“The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes.” ([Leone et al., 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/72G2FEPR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/V29AGGH5?page=1&annotation=5JMVHSZ7))

## Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation

“There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form” ([Lindson et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8FIAFQDF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/KBISQA9V?page=5&annotation=P4WLBGPF))

“ive studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I 2 = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit” ([Lindson et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8FIAFQDF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/KBISQA9V?page=5&annotation=BVWLINU9))

“There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking.” ([Lindson et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8FIAFQDF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/KBISQA9V?page=5&annotation=IG6JMZK4))

## Machine learning for precision medicine

“One major benefitof most machine learning models is that no strict assumptions about the data distribution (e.g., normal distribution) are made.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 419](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=4&annotation=WJLKJ8XV))

“Due to the regularization used in many machine learning methods, most machine learning models can also handle noisy data and large variances within the dataset comparatively well” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 419](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=4&annotation=HRNNWWFA))

“Conversely, machine learning also has limitations. For example, the ability to identify complex, non-linear patterns also comes along with reduced interpretation capabilities compared to simple linear models.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 419](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=4&annotation=PY7T7RJE))

“For all its promises, precision medicine will not replace the clinicians any time soon but can support and help clinicians considerably with diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment using patient-individual data analyzed using machine learning techniques.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 422](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=7&annotation=D4X3NPBR))

“decisions of many machine learning models are not easy to understand and interpret as noted above, especially with increased complexity of the input data and within the machine learning models themselves. This raises legal and ethical concerns, as research and physicians and other clinicians may not fully understand how a machine learning model came to a specific conclusion about a patient’s care. Current research in the machine learning domain is focussed on increasing the interpretability and thereby decreasing the “black box” nature of machine learning models, which will play a crucial role in the acceptance of such models within clinical decision making, as it will allow the physician or clinician to understand how the machine learning model came to a specific decision that then modifies care of the patient.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 422](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=7&annotation=H5MBZG7E))

“Another major concern with precision medicine is the financial cost. While becoming more affordable as technology advances, genetic testing, imaging, and other clinical investigations are still costly to conduct. Furthermore, precision medicine therapies are amongst the most expensive, for example, the cost of the life prolonging gene therapies for SMA type I (described in the Introduction) is in the range of millions of dollars.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 423](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=8&annotation=UQFRXSR2))

“Privatized for-profit medical systems favour the economically advantaged, as individuals who can afford to pay high costs receive in-depth workups and access to testing, treatments, and interventions that are out of reach for many. This leads to significant disparities in access to care based on socioeconomic status that are unacceptable.” ([MacEachern and Forkert, 2021, p. 423](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/RTADFP9S)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/3SNZSF6C?page=8&annotation=IXLWVTHD))

## Applicability of machine learning algorithm to predict the therapeutic intervention success in Brazilian smokers

“The outcome selected for this study was smoking cessation during the period of 42 days (7 meetings) of the cognitive-behavioral treatment” ([Massago et al., 2024, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/B3MAQQ5F)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/MDQQ7KNN?page=3&annotation=FDWBL5AJ))

“During model performance evaluation of each algorithm and group, we performed cross-validation 10 times for training and testing groups.” ([Massago et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/B3MAQQ5F)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/MDQQ7KNN?page=6&annotation=KFU38NVF))

“The mean global values were: 0.675 ± 0.028 for accuracy, 0.803 ± 0.078 for sensitivity, 0.485 ± 0.146 for specificity, 0.705 ± 0.035 for PPV, and 0.680 ± 0.033 for AUC” ([Massago et al., 2024, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/B3MAQQ5F)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/MDQQ7KNN?page=8&annotation=KXNXMX38))

“n our study itmeasures how the model istrustworthy to identify the participants who will quit smoking ifthey received the cognitive-behavioral treatment. So, itcan be used to establish priorities when the demand ishigher than the capacity” ([Massago et al., 2024, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/B3MAQQ5F)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/MDQQ7KNN?page=10&annotation=XB7CRJS7))

## Big Data in Public Health: Terminology, Machine Learning, and Privacy

“Within the data science field, the “curse of dimensionality”(14) associated with wide datasets has been somewhat alleviated through the adoption of machine learning models, particularly in contexts where prediction or hypothesis generation rather than hypothesis-testing is the analytic goal.” ([Mooney and Pejaver, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/TYCJ52WS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/HQTKYSGK?page=3&annotation=589B5TSD))

“Appropriate use of both big data and machine learning rely on understanding several key limitations of each. First, we observe that machine learning’s capacity to overcome the curse of dimensionality requires tall data sets.(43) Small and/or biased training sets can lead to overfitting (Table 2) which limits the problems that current machine learning methods can address. Second, machine learning models are often described as “black boxes” whose opacity precludes interpretability or sanity-checking of key assumptions by non-experts. (109) While recent work has partially addressed this limitation (Sidebar 4),the problem persists. Third, in some instances, observers assume that models that learn automatically from data are more objective therefore more accurate than human-constructed models. Although data-driven models frequently can predict outcomes better than theory-driven models, data-driven model building also involves subjective decisions, such as choice of training and evaluation data sets, choice of pre-processing criteria, and choice of learning algorithms and initial parameters. These decisions cumulatively result in biases” ([Mooney and Pejaver, 2018, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/TYCJ52WS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/HQTKYSGK?page=8&annotation=K3B4Q2KV))

“Less than half of the articles discussed model usability (n=91, 39.4%), that is, whether and how the model could practically be used in a relevant context. This is an important reporting component of the TRIPOD statement (Discuss the potential clinical use of the model and implications for future research) and is relevant for understanding real-word applications of prediction models.17 Also, only a small number discussed the costs of prediction errors in real-world contexts (n=36, 15.6%).” ([Morgenstern et al., 2020, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/24LNMW3N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/NIIIKE2A?page=7&annotation=Z67LITU9))

“health outcomes tend to be more stochastic. As a result, accurate prediction of probabilities is more important.23 Models can have good predictive discrimination, but poor calibration, making them less useful in practice, particularly for population health applications.” ([Morgenstern et al., 2020, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/24LNMW3N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/NIIIKE2A?page=8&annotation=3ZSZEQBG))

## Machine learning classification of resting state functional connectivity predicts smoking status

“We applied support vector machine (SVM)-based classification to resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from nicotine-dependent smokers and healthy controls to identify brain-based features predictive of nicotine dependence. By employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in predicting smoking status.” ([Pariyadath et al., 2014, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/LMM52LII)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/ACBTMPLV?page=1&annotation=2Y5C8G7H))

## The Quitting Rollercoaster: How Recent Quitting History Affects Future Cessation Outcomes (Data From the International Tobacco Control 4-Country Cohort Study)

“The likelihood of a future quit attempt increased independently with recency and number of prior attempts. By contrast, the likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence of at least 6 months was reduced for smokers with a failed quit attempt within the last year (15.1% vs. 27.1% for those without, p < .001). Two or more failed attempts (vs. only one) in the previous year were also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.85). Effects persisted after controlling for levels of addiction, self-efficacy to quit, and use of stop-smoking medications.” ([Partos et al., 2013, p. 1578](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/K8M9FNDX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/P8CPSCHI?page=1&annotation=WY6Y25KI))

## Classification of Lapses in Smokers Attempting to Stop: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach Using Data From a Popular Smoking Cessation Smartphone App

“Because of the nonuniform frequency of craving feature entries within and across participants, same-time (as opposed to lagged) predictor-outcome relationships were modeled.” ([Perski et al., 2023, p. 1332](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8JJUXK8M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/AC6ZQMK4?page=3&annotation=6ZUCB2UY))

“A total of 19 365 participants registered to use the “pro” version of the Smoke Free app within the study period, with 14 419 (74.5%) participants eligible for inclusion (see Figure 1). Of these participants, 791 (5.5%) had made ≥20 craving entries within 3 months from the date of app registration” ([Perski et al., 2023, p. 1332](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/8JJUXK8M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/AC6ZQMK4?page=3&annotation=YNL7ZIXN))

## Interventions for Tobacco Smoking

“Many researchers now view tobacco dependence as a chronic disease (Fiore et al 2008). Most smokers need to make repeated quit attempts before quitting permanently, and this realization has led to chronic care models of smoking intervention (e.g., Joseph et al 2011). Such models build in contingencies for patients who relapse and offer appropriate ongoing care to smokers regardless of their willingness to quit or where they are in the quitting process (e.g., recently quit or relapsed).” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=2&annotation=W3785YNP))

“Phase-Based Model of Tobacco Use (Baker et al 2011)” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=2&annotation=YHSEWD7M))

“counseling alone (of varying intensities) produced an estimated 5-month (or longer) abstinence rate of 14.6%, while the combination of counseling + medication produced an abstinence rate of 22.1%. Conversely, a PHS Clinical Practice Guideline meta-analysis of a different set of studies compared the effects of smoking medication alone versus medication + counseling. This analysis showed that across 18 studies, counseling (of varying intensities) raised estimated 5-month (or longer) abstinence rates from 21.7% to 27.6% (Fiore et al 2008). These findings underscore practice guideline recommendations that cessation treatments combine counseling and medication whenever possible (e.g., Fiore et al 2008).” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 12](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=12&annotation=648BISFN))

“Other studies have shown that over 7 to 10 years, a health care system or insurer will recoup almost all their investment in smoking cessation treatments, and that quitters will gain on average 7 additional years of life (Fiore et al 2008)” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 15](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=15&annotation=5X59ZJZI))

“The smoker who has remained essentially abstinent (except, perhaps, for occasional lapses) for the first 2 to 3 weeks following the target quit day can be considered to have moved from the Cessation Phase to the Maintenance Phase” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 16](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=16&annotation=ZMWMLYS7))

“Most smokers who ultimately relapse have their first cigarette quite early in the quit attempt. Perhaps 70% or so of those who relapse within the first 6 months start smoking within the first 2 weeks (Kenford et al 1994), but escalation to relapse per se often unfolds slowly and stretches out over weeks with smoking occurring at a gradually accelerating pace (Kirchner et al 2012)” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 16](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=16&annotation=93ZHEPUV))

“almost 80% of smokers making a quit attempt reported relapsing in the first 3 months, but 60% of the remaining smokers relapsed between months 3 and 6. The relapse rate amongst smokers who maintained abstinence for at least 6 months decreased to less than 20% for the following 12 months. Thus, initial smoking early in the quit attempt may set the stage for ultimate relapse, but even months of abstinence do not guarantee lasting success.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 16](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=16&annotation=GT7TH6ER))

“Smokers who are 2 to 3 weeks into a quit attempt may have experienced the worst of withdrawal, but clearly they still face challenges that often derail their abstinence. The leading threats include: decreased self-efficacy (especially after lapses: Gwaltney et al 2009, Kirchner et al 2012); the premature cessation of either medication or counseling (Tonstad et al 2006); poor medication adherence (Stapleton et al 1995); frequent exposure to smoking cues (Loh et al 2012, Shiffman et al 1996b); and unexpected exacerbations of withdrawal craving that may occur weeks after the quit day (Piasecki et al 2003). How these events unfold as a process is not yet clear. What is clear is that smoking a cigarette after the quit day starts a cascade of events that typically progresses to full relapse, including a plunge in self-efficacy, demoralization and withdrawal from treatment.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 16](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=16&annotation=5PUEZ5BI)) CRITICAL FOR WHY IT MATTERS A LOT TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS IN FIRST FEW WEEKS

“Multiple literature reviews have documented the need for more effective relapse prevention/ maintenance interventions (e.g., Agboola et al 2010, Brandon et al 2007, Carroll 1996). Unfortunately, few studies have explored novel approaches to maintenance, which has limited progress, and limits the scope of this review.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 17](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=17&annotation=X4VYEHHJ))

“Several studies suggest that very extended counseling (which generally involves both intratreatment support and skills training) may reduce relapse risk (Hall et al 2004, Killen et al 2008, Mermelstein et al 2003)” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 17](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=17&annotation=HGJDHQAS))

“In sum, ongoing counseling over the course of a year does appear to increase long-term abstinence rates meaningfully, and these increases appear to be persistent. While these findings are impressive and encouraging, their translation into general practice may be limited because of cost and because many smokers may be unwilling to commit so much time and effort to quitting.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 17](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=17&annotation=2N4JD5EN))

“Effects similar to those achieved with person-to-person skills training can perhaps be obtained using written or computerized interventions” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 18](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=18&annotation=MKELFZ5N))

“The weight of the evidence suggests that extending the use of smoking medication enhances long-term smoking abstinence (Agboola et al 2010, Schnoll et al 2010, Tonstad et al 2006), and that termination of smoking medication (NRT in this particular meta-analysis) increases the likelihood of relapse (Medioni et al 2005)” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 18](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=18&annotation=HSZWG5W2))

“However, the effects of prolonged medication tend to be modest; these modest effects must be weighed against the costs, relatively low adherence, and side effects of such medication regimens.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 18](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=18&annotation=33ZPVJT6))

“In the Relapse Recovery phase, a person has returned to smoking after a quit attempt. As noted earlier, relapse is modal amongst those trying to quit. Even when smokers receive considerable counseling plus smoking medication, the great majority relapse by 6 months after the quit attempt” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=19&annotation=8YFRTFY5))

“Recently relapsed smokers may enter relapse recovery treatment with some decided strengths. One is that some of their tobacco dependence may have diminished during the prior period of abstinence. Also, smokers who relapse tend to smoke fewer cigarettes per day than they did before they quit, even with no training or encouragement to do so and this may promote later successful cessation” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=19&annotation=IPAHE5BQ))

“Relapse exacts some severe costs, though, and these may undermine recovery. It frequently causes demoralization (Kirchner et al 2012, Shiffman et al 1997) and can lead smokers to disengage from smoking treatment and refuse to engage in renewed quit attempts. Once smokers fail in a quit attempt, they may not make another quit attempt for many months or longer.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=19&annotation=29PJ387C))

“Most tested post-relapse interventions merely recycle smokers through additional rounds of cessation treatment and do not offer a treatment option for smokers not interested in making an immediate quit attempt (e.g., Ellerbeck et al 2009). Only Joseph et al., (Joseph et al 2011) have tested a relapse response intervention consistent with a chronic care model.” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=19&annotation=SL63QNDA))

“A crucial question that deserves further research is the nature of the treatment goal that recently relapsed smokers should be encouraged to pursue. The traditional goal of most relapse recovery treatments is that the smoker make an immediate new quit attempt. However, this approach may put too much pressure on a smoker whose confidence and selfefficacy have been shaken. The alternative, as manifested in the Joseph study (Joseph et al 2011), is to encourage relapsed smokers to adopt a smoking reduction goal—including using smoking medication and behavioral training to limit the amount they smoke (e.g., substituting smoking medication for cigarettes, eliminating smoking in key contexts). This strategy could be considered either a long-term harm reduction strategy (although the extent to which smoking reduction decreases harm is not known; Hughes & Carpenter 2006); or a transitional stage leading to a new quit attempt at a later point in time” ([Schlam and Baker, 2013, p. 20](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/X8AC85LB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/W88M4NKM?page=20&annotation=MRRTWB7T))

## Nicotine metabolic rate predicts successful smoking cessation with transdermal nicotine: A validation study

“A sample of 568 smokers was enrolled in a study that provided counseling and 8-weeks of 21mg nicotine patch. Pretreatment 3-HC/cotinine ratio was examined as a predictor of 7-day point prevalence abstinence, verified with breath carbon monoxide (CO), 8 weeks after the quit date. Controlling for sex, race, age, and nicotine dependence, smokers in the upper 3 quartiles of 3-HC/cotinine ratio (faster metabolizers) were ~50% less likely to be abstinent vs. smokers in the first quartile (slow metabolizers; 28% vs. 42%; OR=. 54 [95% CI: .36–.82], p=.003).” ([Schnoll et al., 2009, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/4AEQ2DGY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/AWG85A82?page=1&annotation=LTZTJSN6))

“These data support the value of the 3-HC/cotinine ratio as a biomarker to predict success with transdermal nicotine for smoking cessation.” ([Schnoll et al., 2009, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/4AEQ2DGY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/AWG85A82?page=1&annotation=EALJ4J9Z))

## Does the nicotine metabolite ratio moderate smoking cessation treatment outcomes in real-world settings? A prospective study

“The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence at both follow-up times. Main explanatory variables were (1) NMR status [slow (NMR < 0.31, n = 451) versus normal (NMR ≥ 0.31, n = 1105) metabolizers]; (2) pharmacotherapy (varenicline versus NRT) and (3) behavioural support (individual versus group-based treatment). Analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic, SSS, mental/physical health and smoking characteristics.” ([Shahab et al., 2019, p. 304](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/YAPUVW52)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/FPV8KQSL?page=1&annotation=9HCBRUDB))

“In a real-world setting, the nicotine metabolite ratio status of treatmentseeking smokers does not appear to contribute substantially to the differential effectiveness of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in Stop Smoking Services, when both pharmacotherapy and behavioural support are self-selected.” ([Shahab et al., 2019, p. 304](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/YAPUVW52)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/FPV8KQSL?page=1&annotation=EVPEK6FH))

## The Use of the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio as a Biomarker to Personalize Smoking Cessation Treatment: Current Evidence and Future Directions

“offers several advantages over genotyping, making it better suited for personalizing smoking cessation treatments. First, the NMR reflects the substantial influence of CYP2A6 genetic variation as well as the influence of other genetic and environmental factors known to influence nicotine clearance in vivo (e.g., age, race, hormonal factors, and smoking itself; refs. 35, 36). Second, the NMR can be assessed noninvasively (i.e., from saliva or plasma, with high reliability, or urine with moderate reliability, without additional drug administration) based on metabolite levels from nicotine derived from the smokers’ usual cigarettes.” ([Siegel et al., 2020, p. 262](zotero://select/groups/40632/items/78QGJC4M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/40632/items/QWXTHMM8?page=2&annotation=RWE5S434))
