<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Precision mental health seeks to select the right treatment for a patient given personal characteristics. The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model that could select among first-line medication treatments for cigarette smoking. We used data from a previously completed comparative effectiveness trial in which participants were richly characterized at baseline before being randomly assigned to varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy, or nicotine patch. We built a model predicting treatment success (abstinent vs. smoking) using baseline characteristics and their interactions with treatment. Models were fit, selected, and evaluated using nested cross-validation and the performance metric area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (auROC). Our best models had a median auROC of 0.69 in held-out test sets. We used this model to calculcate probabilities of treatment success for each participant on each of the three treatments to identify their model-predicted best treatment. Individuals who were matched to their model-predicted best treatment during the original trial were more likely to quit successfully at 4 weeks than individuals who were not (OR = 1.382, p = 0.014) but not at later timepoints. This project produces a clinically implementable treatment selection model to assist people quitting cigarette smoking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of a machine learning framework to predict substance use disorder treatment success;,citation_abstract=There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.;,citation_author=Laura Acion;,citation_author=Diana Kelmansky;,citation_author=Mark Laan;,citation_author=Ethan Sahker;,citation_author=DeShauna Jones;,citation_author=Stephan Arndt;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0175383;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=28394905;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS One;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Utility of Machine-Learning Approaches to Identify Behavioral Markers for Substance Use Disorders: Impulsivity Dimensions as Predictors of Current Cocaine Dependence;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Identifying objective and accurate markers of cocaine dependence (CD) can innovate its prevention and treatment. Existing evidence suggests that CD is characterized by a wide range of cognitive deficits, most notably by increased impulsivity. Impulsivity is multidimensional and it is unclear which of its various dimensions would have the highest predictive utility for CD. The machine-learning approach is highly promising for discovering predictive markers of disease. Here, we used machine learning to identify multivariate predictive patterns of impulsivity phenotypes that can accurately classify individuals with CD. METHODS: Current cocaine-dependent users (N = 31) and healthy controls (N = 23) completed the self-report Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 and five neurocognitive tasks indexing different dimensions of impulsivity: (1) Immediate Memory Task (IMT), (2) Stop-Signal Task, (3) Delay-Discounting Task (DDT), (4) Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and (5) Probabilistic Reversal-Learning task. We applied a machine-learning algorithm to all impulsivity measures. RESULTS: Machine learning accurately classified individuals with CD and predictions were generalizable to new samples (area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.912 in the test set). CD membership was predicted by higher scores on motor and non-planning trait impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and discriminability on the IMT, higher delay discounting on the DDT, and poor decision making on the IGT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that multivariate behavioral impulsivity phenotypes can predict CD with high degree of accuracy, which can potentially be used to assess individuals’ vulnerability to CD in clinical settings.;,citation_author=Woo-Young Ahn;,citation_author=Divya Ramesh;,citation_author=Frederick Gerard Moeller;,citation_author=Jasmin Vassileva;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00034;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_pmid=27014100;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.;,citation_author=Sangwon Bae;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Denzil Ferreira;,citation_author=Anind K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Nicotine Patch vs Varenicline vs Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy on Smoking Cessation at 26 Weeks: A Randomized Clinical Trial;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week quit rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three-group randomized intention-to-treat clinical trial occurring from May 2012 to November 2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, communities; 65.5% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) refused participation prior to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch only (n = 241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; n = 424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge; n = 421). Six counseling sessions were offered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52. RESULTS: Among 1086 smokers randomized (52% women; 67% white; mean age, 48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84%) provided 12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8% [55/241]; varenicline, 23.6% [100/424]; and C-NRT, 26.8% [113/421]) or at 52 weeks (nicotine patch, 20.8% [50/241]; varenicline, 19.1% [81/424]; and C-NRT, 20.2% [85/421]). At 26 weeks, the risk differences for abstinence were, for patch vs varenicline, -0.76% (95% CI, -7.4% to 5.9%); for patch vs C-NRT, -4.0% (95% CI, -10.8% to 2.8%); and for varenicline vs C-NRT, -3.3% (95% CI, -9.1% to 2.6%). All medications were well tolerated, but varenicline produced more frequent adverse events than did the nicotine patch for vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and indigestion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or C-NRT produced no significant differences in biochemically confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise questions about the relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01553084.;,citation_author=Timothy B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Smoking Treatment: A Report Card on Progress and Challenges;,citation_abstract=The impact of tobacco smoking treatment is determined by its reach into the smoking population and the effectiveness of its interventions. This review evaluates the reach and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for smoking. Historically, the reach of smoking treatment has been low, and therefore its impact has been limited, but new reach strategies such as digital interventions and health care system changes offer great promise. Pharmacotherapy tends to be more effective than psychosocial intervention when used clinically, and newer pharmacotherapy strategies hold great promise of further enhancing effectiveness. However, new approaches are needed to advance psychosocial interventions; progress has stagnated because research and dissemination efforts have focused too narrowly on skill training despite evidence that its core content may be inconsequential and the fact that its mechanisms are either unknown or inconsistent with supporting theory. Identifying effective psychosocial content and its mechanisms of action could greatly enhance the effectiveness of counseling, digital, and web interventions.;,citation_author=Timothy B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurocognitive dysfunction in addiction: Testing hypotheses of diffuse versus selective phenotypic dysfunction with a classification-based approach;,citation_abstract=Neurocognitive dysfunctions are frequently identified in the addictions. These dysfunctions may indicate either diffuse dysfunction or may represent separate facets that have differential importance to the addiction phenotype. In a sample (n = 260) of alcohol and/or stimulant users and controls we measured responses across 7 diverse neurocognitive measures. These measures were Continuous Performance, Delay Discounting, Iowa Gambling, Stroop, Tower, Wisconsin Card Sorting, and Letter Number Sequencing. Comparisons were then made between the drug-dependent groups and controls using analysis of variance and also using a machine learning approach to classify participants based on task performance as substance-dependent or controls in 1 tree and as alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls in a second tree. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups on the Delay Discounting (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), Iowa Gambling (p $&amp;lt;$ .001), Letter Number Sequencing (p $<$ .001), and Wisconsin Card Sorting (p $<$ .05) tasks. The first classification tree correctly classified between substance-dependent or controls for 88.3% of participants and classified between alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls for 63.9% of participants. Delay discounting was the first split in both trees and in the substance-dependent and control tree. The analysis of variance results largely replicate previous findings. The machine learning classification tree analysis provides evidence to support the hypothesis that different measures of neurocognitive dysfunction represent different processes. Among them, delay discounting was the most robust in categorizing drug dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Warren K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=DALEX: Explainers for Complex Predictive Models in R;,citation_abstract=Predictive modeling is invaded by elastic, yet complex methods such as neural networks or ensembles (model stacking, boosting or bagging). Such methods are usually described by a large number of parameters or hyper parameters - a price that one needs to pay for elasticity. The very number of parameters makes models hard to understand. This paper describes a consistent collection of explainers for predictive models, a.k.a. black boxes. Each explainer is a technique for exploration of a black box model. Presented approaches are model-agnostic, what means that they extract useful information from any predictive method irrespective of its internal structure. Each explainer is linked with a specific aspect of a model. Some are useful in decomposing predictions, some serve better in understanding performance, while others are useful in understanding importance and conditional responses of a particular variable. Every explainer presented here works for a single model or for a collection of models. In the latter case, models can be compared against each other. Such comparison helps to find strengths and weaknesses of different models and gives additional tools for model validation. Presented explainers are implemented in the DALEX package for R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polygenic Risk Scores in Clinical Psychology: Bridging Genomic Risk to Individual Differences;,citation_abstract=Genomewide association studies (GWASs) across psychiatric phenotypes have shown that common genetic variants generally confer risk with small effect sizes (odds ratio $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 1.1) that additively contribute to polygenic risk. Summary statistics derived from large discovery GWASs can be used to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in independent, target data sets to examine correlates of polygenic disorder liability (e.g., does genetic liability to schizophrenia predict cognition?). The intuitive appeal and generalizability of PRS have led to their widespread use and new insights into mechanisms of polygenic liability. However, when currently applied across traits they account for small amounts of variance ($&amp;lt;$3%), are relatively uninformative for clinical treatment, and, in isolation, provide no insight into molecular mechanisms. Larger GWASs are needed to increase the precision of PRS, and novel approaches integrating various data sources (e.g., multitrait analysis of GWASs) may improve the utility of current PRS.;,citation_author=Ryan Bogdan;,citation_author=David A.

In this paper we argue that the replicability of a test is also of importance. We say that a test has low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular random partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and relapse prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation;,citation_abstract=Background , When people stop smoking they experience cravings to smoke and unpleasant mood changes. Nicotine receptor partial agonists aim to reduce these withdrawal symptoms and the pleasure people usually experience when they smoke. The most widely-available treatment in this drug type is varenicline, which is available world-wide as an aid for quitting smoking. Cytisine is a similar medication, but is only available in Central and Eastern European countries and through internet sales., Study characteristics , We searched for randomised controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisine or dianicline. We found 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. We also found four trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. We include one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a quitting aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the start of treatment. We preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids.We conducted full searches up to May 2015, although we have also included several key trials published after that date., Key findings , From the information we found (27 trials, 12,625 people), varenicline at standard dose more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo. Low-dose varenicline (four trials, 1266 people) roughly doubled the chances of quitting, and reduced the number and severity of side effects. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion (five trials, 5877 people) or with NRT (eight trials, 6264 people). Based on the evidence so far, we can calculate that varenicline delivers one extra successful quitter for every 11 people treated, compared with smokers trying to quit without varenicline., The most common side effect of varenicline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time. People taking varenicline appear to have about a 25% increased chance of a serious adverse event, although these include many which are unrelated to the treatment. We also note that more people were lost from the control groups than from the varenicline groups by the end of the trials, which may mean that the count of events in the control groups is lower than it should be. After varenicline became available to use, there were concerns that it could be linked with an increase in depressed mood, agitation, or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers. However, the latest evidence does not support a link between varenicline and these disorders, although people with past or current psychiatric illness may be at slightly higher risk. There have also been concerns that varenicline may slightly increase heart and circulatory problems in people already at increased risk of these illnesses. The evidence is currently unclear whether or not they are caused or made worse by varenicline, but we should have clearer answers to these questions when a further study is published later this year., Quality of the evidence , The varenicline studies were generally of high quality, providing evidence that we consider to be reliable and robust. We rate the quality of the evidence comparing varenicline with NRT as moderate quality (we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), since in some of them the participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. non-blinded open-label trials). We judge the evidence from the cytsine trials to be of low quality (we have limited confidence in the evidence), as there are only two trials, with relatively low numbers included.;,citation_author=Kate Cahill;,citation_author=Nicola Lindson-Hawley;,citation_author=Kyla H Thomas;,citation_author=Thomas R Fanshawe;,citation_author=Tim Lancaster;,citation_publication_date=2016-05;,citation_cover_date=2016-05;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006103.pub7;,citation_issn=1469-493X;,citation_pmid=27158893;,citation_volume=2016;,citation_journal_title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: An overview and network meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? METHODS: The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with ’smoking’ in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than ’other’ NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from ’other’ NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin’s UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine’s potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.;,citation_author=Kate Cahill;,citation_author=Sarah Stevens;,citation_author=Rafael Perera;,citation_author=Tim Lancaster;,citation_publication_date=2013-05;,citation_cover_date=2013-05;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2;,citation_issn=1469-493X;,citation_pmid=23728690;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimating the number of quit attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully in a longitudinal cohort of smokers;,citation_abstract=Objectives The number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit successfully is a commonly reported figure among smoking cessation programmes, but previous estimates have been based on lifetime recall in cross-sectional samples of successful quitters only. The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations.;,citation_author=Michael Chaiton;,citation_author=Lori Diemert;,citation_author=Joanna E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic Variant in CHRNA5 and Response to Varenicline and Combination Nicotine Replacement in a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=It is unclear if genetic variants affect smoking cessation treatment response. This study tested whether variants in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit (CHRNA5) predict response to smoking cessation medication by directly comparing the two most effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. In this genotype-stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (May 2015–August 2019 in St Louis, Missouri), smokers were randomized by genotype in blocks of six (1:1:1 ratio) to three conditions: 12 weeks of placebo (n = 273), combination nicotine patch and lozenge (combination nicotine replacement therapy, cNRT, n = 275), or varenicline (n = 274). All participants received counseling and were followed for 12 months. The primary end point was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT, week 12). Trial registration and eligibility criteria are on clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT02351167). We conducted the genetic analyses separately for 516 European ancestry (EA) smokers and 306 non-EA smokers (including 270 African American smokers). In African American smokers, there was a genotype-by-treatment interaction for EOT abstinence ($\chi$2 = 10.7, degrees of freedom = 2. P = 0.0049): specifically, cNRT was more effective in smokers with rs16969968 GG genotype than was placebo, while varenicline was more effective in smokers of GA/AA genotypes. In EA ancestry smokers, there was no significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. In the whole sample, although both were effective at EOT, only varenicline, and not cNRT, was significantly effective relative to placebo at 6-month follow-up. Importantly, this study suggests that genetic information can further enhance smoking cessation treatment effectiveness.;,citation_author=Li-Shiun Chen;,citation_author=Timothy B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Nicotine Metabolite Ratio is Associated With Early Smoking Abstinence Even After Controlling for Factors That Influence the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio;,citation_abstract=The decrease in smoking rates in North America has plateaued, underscoring the need for new approaches to treat nicotine dependence. Inter-individual differences in smoking behavior result, in part, from variation in the rate of CYP2A6 -mediated nicotine metabolism. A phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity is the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), the ratio of 3$\prime$hydroxycotinine/cotinine. The NMR is associated with smoking cessation. However, the NMR is also associated with genetic (eg, CYP2A6 genotype) and other (eg, sex and ethnicity) factors. Here we aimed to determine if previously identified non- CYP2A6 sources of variation in the NMR mitigated the association between the NMR and short-term abstinence. The NMR was determined from blood samples collected at intake from daily smokers aged 18–65. Biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide level $\leq$ 8 ppm) was measured at 1 week following the target quit date in participants from a smoking cessation clinical trial (NCT01314001). Analyses were restricted to N = 462 blacks and N = 693 whites in the intent-to-treat sample. Lower NMR (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.31) was associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence ( OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, alcohol, and cigarette consumption.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pathways to precision medicine in smoking cessation treatments;,citation_abstract=Cigarette smoking is highly addictive and modern genetic research has identified robust genetic influences on nicotine dependence. An important step in translating these genetic findings to clinical practice is identifying the genetic factors affecting smoking cessation in order to enhance current smoking cessation treatments. We reviewed the significant genetic variants that predict nicotine dependence, smoking cessation, and response to cessation pharmacotherapy. These data suggest that genetic risks can predict smoking cessation outcomes and moderate the effect of pharmacological treatments. Some pharmacogenetic findings have been replicated in meta-analyses or in multiple smoking cessation trials. The variation in efficacy between smokers with different genetic markers supports the notion that personalized smoking cessation intervention based upon genotype could maximize the efficiency of such treatment while minimizing side effects, thus influencing the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm. In summary, as precision medicine is revolutionizing healthcare, smoking cessation may be one of the first areas where genetic variants may identify individuals at increased risk. Current evidence strongly suggests that genetic variants predict cessation failure and that cessation pharmacotherapy effectiveness is modulated by biomarkers such as nicotinic cholinergic receptor $\alpha$5 subunit (CHRNA5) genotypes or nicotine metabolism ratio (NMR). These findings strengthen the case for the development and rigorous testing of treatments that target patients with different biological risk profiles.;,citation_author=Li-Shiun Chen;,citation_author=Amy Horton;,citation_author=Laura Bierut;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2016.05.033;,citation_issn=1872-7972;,citation_pmid=27208830;,citation_volume=669;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neuroscience Letters;">

For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,$\lambda$) penalty with $\lambda\rightarrow$0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior.;,citation_author=Yeojin Chung;,citation_author=Sophia Rabe-Hesketh;,citation_author=Vincent Dorie;,citation_author=Andrew Gelman;,citation_author=Jingchen Liu;,citation_publication_date=2013-10;,citation_cover_date=2013-10;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11336-013-9328-2;,citation_issn=1860-0980;,citation_volume=78;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychometrika;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD): The TRIPOD Statement;,citation_abstract=Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Machine-Learning Approach to Predicting Smoking Cessation Treatment Outcomes;,citation_abstract=Most cigarette smokers want to quit smoking and more than half make an attempt every year, but less than 10% remain abstinent for at least 6 months. Evidence-based tobacco use treatment improves the likelihood of quitting, but more than two-thirds of individuals relapse when provided even the most robust treatments. Identifying for whom treatment is effective will improve the success of our treatments and perhaps identify strategies for improving current approaches.Two cohorts (training: N = 90, validation: N = 71) of cigarette smokers enrolled in group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify baseline predictors of outcome, as defined by breath carbon monoxide and urine cotinine. Significant measures were entered as candidate variables to predict quit status. The resulting decision trees were used to predict cessation outcomes in a validation cohort.In the training cohort, the decision trees significantly improved on chance classification of smoking status following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The first split of all decision trees, which was delay discounting, significantly improved on chance classification rates in both the training and validation cohort. Delay discounting emerged as the single best predictor of group CBT treatment response with an average baseline discount rate of ln(k) = -7.1, correctly predicting smoking status of 80% of participants at posttreatment and 81% of participants at follow-up.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation though future work is needed to identify individuals that are likely to be successful in treatments beyond group CBT.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation. Using a novel machine-learning approach, baseline measures of clinical and executive functioning are used to predict smoking cessation outcomes following group CBT. A decision point is recommended for the single best predictor of treatment outcomes, delay discounting, to inform future research or clinical practice in an effort to better allocate patients to treatments that are likely to work.;,citation_author=Lara N Coughlin;,citation_author=Allison N Tegge;,citation_author=Christine E Sheffer;,citation_author=Warren K Bickel;,citation_publication_date=2020-03;,citation_cover_date=2020-03;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/ntr/nty259;,citation_issn=1469-994X;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=Nicotine &amp;amp;amp; Tobacco Research;">

Design: Cross-sectional and correlational. Method: The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS). Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon &amp; Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.;,citation_author=John R. Crawford;,citation_author=Julie D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A pilot trial of In vivo NRT sampling to increase medication adherence in community corrections smokers;,citation_abstract=Background Individuals in the criminal justice system demonstrate high rates of cigarette use (70–80%) and low adherence to smoking cessation medication. Educational approaches have not been shown to promote adherence or cessation, though medication sampling has boosted both use and cessation. The objective of the present study was to determine whether In vivo nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling approach increases NRT adherence among criminal justice smokers during a subsequent quit attempt. Methods We conducted a pilot study with 43 community corrections smokers randomized to a 4-session (one 30-min session per week) precessation intervention of either In vivo NRT sampling (Session 1: patch; Session 2: gum; Session 3: combination NRT (cNRT); Session 4: review) vs. 4 time-matched sessions of standard smoking cessation with cNRT started after Session 1. Both groups received an additional 8weeks of cNRT following the four intervention sessions. Results During the in vivo administration of NRT, total withdrawal and craving severity significantly decreased from pre- to post-session compared to Control participants. In vivo participants evinced greater patch use at Session 4 and greater gum use through Week 8 relative to Controls. Discussion In vivo NRT sampling may increase NRT adherence relative to standard counseling sessions among criminal justice smokers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The history, current status, and possible future of precision mental health;,citation_abstract=In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Personalized Advantage Index: Translating research on prediction into individualized treatment recommendations. A demonstration;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Advances in personalized medicine require the identification of variables that predict differential response to treatments as well as the development and refinement of methods to transform predictive information into actionable recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate and test a new method for integrating predictive information to aid in treatment selection, using data from a randomized treatment comparison. METHOD: Data from a trial of antidepressant medications (N$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$104) versus cognitive behavioral therapy (N$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$50) for Major Depressive Disorder were used to produce predictions of post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) in each of the two treatments for each of the 154 patients. The patient’s own data were not used in the models that yielded these predictions. Five pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response (marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression models, permitting the calculation of each patient’s Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units. RESULTS: For 60% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI$\geq$3) was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their &amp;amp;amp;quot;Optimal&amp;quot; treatment versus those assigned to their &quot;Non-optimal&quot; treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$0.58, 95% CI .17-1.01).

The application of AI models for predicting recidivism has brought positive effects by minimizing the possible re-occurrence of crime. However, the question remains of whether criminal justice system stakeholders can trust AI systems regarding fairness, transparency, privacy and data protection, consistency, societal well-being, and accountability when predicting convicted individuals’ possible risk of recidivism. These are all requirements for a trustworthy AI. This paper conducted a systematic literature review examining trust and the different requirements for trustworthy AI applied to predicting the risks of recidivism.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Methods and Challenges for Assessing Heterogeneity;,citation_abstract=The widely acknowledged homogeneity assumption limits progress in refining clinical diagnosis, understanding mechanisms, and developing new treatments for mental health disorders. This homogeneity assumption drives both a comorbidity and a heterogeneity problem, where two different approaches tackle the problems. One, a unifying approach, tackles the comorbidity problem by assuming that a single general psychopathology factor underlies multiple disorders. Another, a multifactorial approach, tackles the heterogeneity problem by assuming that disorders comprise multiple subtypes driven by multiple discrete factors. We show how each of these approaches can make useful contributions to mental health–related research and clinical practice. For example, the unifying approach can develop a rapid assessment tool that may be clinically valuable for triaging cases. The multifactorial approach can reveal subtypes that are differentially responsive to treatments and highlight distinct mechanisms leading to similar phenotypes. Because both approaches tackle different problems, both have different limitations. We describe the statistical frameworks that incorporate and adjudicate between both approaches (e.g., the bifactor model, normative modeling, and the functional random forest). Such frameworks can identify whether sets of disorders are more affected by heterogeneity or comorbidity. Therefore, future studies that incorporate such frameworks can provide further insight into the nature of psychopathology.;,citation_author=Eric Feczko;,citation_author=Damien A.

Recent studies reported better effectiveness of varenicline in women and in nicotine normal metabolizers phenotypically determined by nicotine-metabolite ratio. Our objective was to study the influence of nicotine-metabolite ratio, CYP2A6 genotype and sex on the response to nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline. Data were extracted from a longitudinal study which included smokers participating in a smoking cessation program. Response to treatment was defined by the absence of relapse when a set threshold of reduction in cigarettes per day relative to the week before the study was no more reached. The analysis considered total and partial reduction defined by a diminution of 100% and of 90% in cigarettes per day, respectively. The hazard ratio of relapsing was estimated in multivariate Cox regression models including the sex and the nicotine metabolism determined by the phenotype or by CYP2A6 genotyping (rs1801272 and rs28399433). In the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping and in women, the hazard ratio for relapsing was significantly lower with varenicline for a partial decrease (HR = 0.33, 95% CI [0.12, 0.89] and HR = 0.20, 95% CI [0.04, 0.91], respectively) and nonsignificantly lower for a total cessation (HR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.20, 1.0] and HR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.14, 1.0]). When compared with the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping, the hazard ratio for a partial decrease was similar in the normal metabolizers determined by genotyping (HR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.18, 0.94]) while it was significantly lower with varenicline for a total cessation (HR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.26, 0.98]).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance abuse treatment entry, retention, and outcome in women: A review of the literature;,citation_abstract=This paper reviews the literature examining characteristics associated with treatment outcome in women with substance use disorders. A search of the English language literature from 1975 to 2005 using Medline and PsycInfo databases found 280 relevant articles. Ninety percent of the studies investigating gender differences in substance abuse treatment outcomes were published since 1990, and of those, over 40% were published since the year 2000. Only 11.8% of these studies were randomized clinical trials. A convergence of evidence suggests that women with substance use disorders are less likely, over the lifetime, to enter treatment compared to their male counterparts. Once in treatment, however, gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention, completion, or outcome. Gender-specific predictors of outcome do exist, however, and individual characteristics and treatment approaches can differentially affect outcomes by gender. While women-only treatment is not necessarily more effective than mixed-gender treatment, some greater effectiveness has been demonstrated by treatments that address problems more common to substance-abusing women or that are designed for specific subgroups of this population. There is a need to develop and test effective treatments for specific subgroups such as older women with substance use disorders, as well as those with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders. Future research on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gender-specific versus standard treatments, as well as identification of the characteristics of women and men who can benefit from mixed-gender versus single-gender treatments, would advance the field.;,citation_author=Shelly F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cigarette Smoking, Mental Health, and Other Substance Use among Court-Involved Youth;,citation_abstract=Background: Justice-involved youth are at risk to become cigarette smokers as they age, leading to a variety of poor health outcomes. However, little is known about cigarette use among justice-involved youth, especially youth supervised in the community where there is ample opportunity to smoke. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the associations between cigarette smoking, emotional and behavioral functioning, and other substance use among a sample of first-time offending court-involved, non-incarcerated (FTO-CINI) youth. Methods: Youth were recruited from a family court in the Northeast (N = 423). Substance use was self-reported using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA). Emotional and behavioral functioning was measured using the Behavior Assessment Schedule for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2), the Affect Dysregulation Scale (ADS), National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS), and the National Survey of Self-Reported Delinquency (NYS-SRD). Results: About 9.9% of FTO-CINI youth had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. Compared with FTO-CINI youth who had not smoked recently, recent smokers endorsed more emotional and behavioral symptoms, such as school problems (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), internalizing problems (p = .012), inattention/hyperactivity (p = .020), affect dysregulation (p = .044), PTSD symptoms (p = .006), and delinquent behavior (p $&amp;lt;$ .001). Recent smokers were also more likely to use alcohol (OR = 5.61, p $<$ .001), marijuana (OR = 11.27, p $<$ .001), and other drugs (OR = 5.00, p $<$ .001). Conclusions: Recent smoking was higher among FTO-CINI youth than youth in the general population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Switching Smoking-Cessation Medications Following Relapse;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Nicotine dependence is a chronic disorder often characterized by multiple failed quit attempts (QAs). Yet, little is known about the sequence of methods used across multiple QAs or how this may impact future ability to abstain from smoking. This prospective cohort study examines the effectiveness of switching smoking-cessation medications (SCMs) across multiple QAs. METHODS: Adult smokers (aged $\geq$18 years) participating in International Tobacco Control surveys in the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada, and Australia (N=795) who: (1) completed two consecutive surveys between 2006 and 2011; (2) initiated a QA at least 1 month before each survey; and (3) provided data for the primary predictor (SCM use during most recent QA), outcome (1-month point prevalence abstinence), and relevant covariates. Analyses were conducted in 2016. RESULTS: Five SCM user classifications were identified: (1) non-users (43.5%); (2) early users (SCM used for initial, but not subsequent QA; 11.4%); (3) later users (SCM used for subsequent, but not initial QA; 18.4%); (4) repeaters (same SCM used for both QAs; 10.7%); and (5) switchers (different SCM used for each QA; 14.2%). Abstinence rates were lower for non-users (15.9%, OR=0.48, p=0.002), early users (16.6%, OR=0.27, p=0.03), and repeaters (12.4%, OR=0.36, p=0.004) relative to switchers (28.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest smokers will be more successful if they use a SCM in QAs and vary the SCM they use across time. That smokers can increase their odds of quitting by switching SCMs is an important message that could be communicated to smokers.;,citation_author=Bryan W. Heckman;,citation_author=K.

Machine learning models often improve risk estimation for certain subpopulations that may be missed by these metrics. Methods and Results: This article addresses the limitations of commonly reported metrics for performance comparison and proposes additional metrics. Our discussions cover metrics related to overall performance, discrimination, calibration, resolution, reclassification, and model implementation. Models for predicting acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention are used to illustrate the use of these metrics.

No treatment was provided.Most smokers (60%) made multiple transitions among smoking, reduction, and abstinence. Intention to not smoke or quit often did not result in a quit attempt but were still strong predictors of a quit attempt and eventual abstinence. Most quit attempts (79%) lasted less than 1 day; about one fifth (18%) of the participants were abstinent at 12 weeks. The majority of quit attempts (72%) were not preceded by an intention to quit. Such quit attempts were shorter than quit attempts preceded by an intention to quit (&amp;amp;amp;lt;1 day vs. 25 days). Most smokers (67%) used a treatment, and use of a treatment was nonsignificantly associated with greater abstinence (14 days vs. 3 days). Making a quit attempt and failing early predicted an increased probability of a later quit attempt compared to not making a quit attempt early (86% vs. 67%).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for human complex diseases;,citation_abstract=Genetic risk prediction is an important goal in human genetics research and precision medicine. Accurate prediction models will have great impacts on both disease prevention and early treatment strategies. Despite the identification of thousands of disease-associated genetic variants through genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk prediction accuracy remains moderate for most diseases, which is largely due to the challenges in both identifying all the functionally relevant variants and accurately estimating their effect sizes in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper, we introduce AnnoPred, a principled framework that leverages diverse types of genomic and epigenomic functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for complex diseases. AnnoPred is trained using GWAS summary statistics in a Bayesian framework in which we explicitly model various functional annotations and allow for linkage disequilibrium estimated from reference genotype data. Compared with state-of-the-art risk prediction methods, AnnoPred achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy in both extensive simulations and real data.;,citation_author=Yiming Hu;,citation_author=Qiongshi Lu;,citation_author=Ryan Powles;,citation_author=Xinwei Yao;,citation_author=Can Yang;,citation_author=Fang Fang;,citation_author=Xinran Xu;,citation_author=Hongyu Zhao;,citation_publication_date=2017-06;,citation_cover_date=2017-06;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005589;,citation_issn=1553-7358;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS Computational Biology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning application for predicting smoking cessation among US adults: An analysis of waves 1-3 of the PATH study;,citation_abstract=Identifying determinants of smoking cessation is critical for developing optimal cessation treatments and interventions. Machine learning (ML) is becoming more prevalent for smoking cessation success prediction in treatment programs. However, only individuals with an intention to quit smoking cigarettes participate in such programs, which limits the generalizability of the results. This study applies data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), a United States longitudinal nationally representative survey, to select primary determinants of smoking cessation and to train ML classification models for predicting smoking cessation among the general population. An analytical sample of 9,281 adult current established smokers from the PATH survey wave 1 was used to develop classification models to predict smoking cessation by wave 2. Random forest and gradient boosting machines were applied for variable selection, and the SHapley Additive explanation method was used to show the effect direction of the top-ranked variables. The final model predicted wave 2 smoking cessation for current established smokers in wave 1 with an accuracy of 72% in the test dataset. The validation results showed that a similar model could predict wave 3 smoking cessation of wave 2 smokers with an accuracy of 70%. Our analysis indicated that more past 30 days e-cigarette use at the time of quitting, fewer past 30 days cigarette use before quitting, ages older than 18 at smoking initiation, fewer years of smoking, poly tobacco past 30-days use before quitting, and higher BMI resulted in higher chances of cigarette cessation for adult smokers in the US.;,citation_author=Mona Issabakhsh;,citation_author=Luz Maria Sánchez-Romero;,citation_author=Thuy T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Discovery and development of varenicline for smoking cessation;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Tobacco use causes one premature death every six seconds. Current smoking cessation aids include nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion. Although more than 70% of smokers express a desire to quit, fewer than 3% remain abstinent for more than one year, highlighting a critical need for more efficacious smoking cessation treatments. Areas Covered: The authors discuss the rationale, preclinical and clinical development of varenicline for smoking cessation. They cover the formulation of varenicline as a partial agonist at $\alpha$4$\beta$2 receptors, the primary neural substrate for nicotine reward. Then, they discuss evidence from preclinical studies indicating varenicline’s efficacy in blocking nicotine reward, followed by clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in sustaining abstinence in smokers. Finally, they cover post-market surveillance, including contraindications in heavy machine operators, putative cardiovascular risk, and the repealed warning for adverse neuropsychiatric events. Expert opinion: Varenicline development was based on strong theoretical rationale and preclinical evidence. Clinical studies indicate that varenicline is safe and more effective in sustaining abstinence than placebo, bupropion or nicotine replacement therapies. However, given that continuous abstinence rates across studies remain low (18~30% with varenicline; 4~10% with placebo), novel and more effective medications targeting other nicotinic or glutamate receptors for smoking cessation are required.;,citation_author=Chloe J.

We extend the basic results from logit and probit to difference-in-differences models, models with higher powers of explanatory variables, other nonlinear models (including log transformation and ordered models), and panel data models. Empirical Application We show how to calculate and interpret interaction effects using a publicly available Stata data set with a binary outcome.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rate of Nicotine Metabolism and Smoking Cessation Outcomes in a Community-based Sample of Treatment-Seeking Smokers;,citation_abstract=Background In samples from controlled randomized clinical trials, a smoker’s rate of nicotine metabolism, measured by the 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio (NMR), predicts response to transdermal nicotine. Replication of this relationship in community-based samples of treatment-seeking smokers may help guide the implementation of the NMR for personalized treatment for nicotine dependence. Methods Data from a community-based sample of treatment seeking smokers (N=499) who received 8weeks of transdermal nicotine and 4 behavioral counseling sessions were used to evaluate associations between the NMR and smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes included withdrawal and craving, depression and anxiety, side effects, and treatment adherence. Results The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR=.56, 95% CI: 0.33-0.95, p=.03), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates than slower metabolizers (24% vs. 33%). Faster nicotine metabolizers exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms over time during treatment, vs. slower metabolizers (NMR x Time interaction: F[3,357]=3.29, p=.02). NMR was not associated with changes in withdrawal, craving, depression, side effects, and treatment adherence (p’s$&amp;amp;amp;gt;$.05). Conclusions In a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers, faster nicotine metabolizers were significantly less likely to quit smoking and showed higher rates of anxiety symptoms during a smoking cessation treatment program, vs. slower nicotine metabolizers. These results provide further evidence that transdermal nicotine is less effective for faster nicotine metabolizers and suggest the need to address cessation-induced anxiety symptoms among these smokers to increase the chances for successful smoking cessation.;,citation_author=Amanda Kaufmann;,citation_author=Brian Hitsman;,citation_author=Patricia M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Searching for Personalized Medicine for Binge Drinking Smokers: Smoking Cessation Using Varenicline, Nicotine Patch, or Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy;,citation_abstract=Objective: Heavy drinking is common among smokers and is associated with especially poor health outcomes. Varenicline may affect mechanisms and clinical outcomes that are relevant for both smoking cessation and alcohol use. The current study examines whether varenicline, relative to nicotine replacement therapy, yields better smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinking smokers. Method: Secondary data analyses of a comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of three smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (12 weeks of varenicline, nicotine patch, or nicotine patch and lozenge) paired with six counseling sessions were conducted. Adult daily cigarette smokers (N = 1,078, 52% female) reported patterns of alcohol use, cigarette craving, and alcohol-related cigarette craving at baseline and over 4 weeks after quitting. Smoking cessation outcome was 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Results: Binge drinkers had higher relapse rates than moderate drinkers at 4-week post-target quit day but not at the end of treatment or long-term follow up (12 and 26 weeks). Varenicline did not yield superior smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinkers, nor did it affect alcohol use early in the quit attempt. Varenicline did produce relatively large reductions in alcohol-related cigarette craving and overall cigarette craving during the first 4 weeks after quitting. Conclusions: Varenicline did not yield higher smoking abstinence rates or reduce alcohol use among binge drinkers. Varenicline did reduce alcohol-related cigarette craving but this did not translate to meaningful differences in smoking abstinence. Varenicline’s effects on smoking abstinence do not appear to vary significantly as a function of drinking status.;,citation_author=Jesse T. Kaye;,citation_author=Adrienne L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence of smoking and other health risk factors in people attending residential substance abuse treatment;,citation_abstract=Introduction and Aims. People attending substance abuse treatment have an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Consequently, there have been increasing calls for substance abuse treatment services to address smoking. The current study examined smoking behaviours of people attending residential substance abuse treatment. Additionally, the study examined rates of other potentially modifiable health risk factors for the development of CVD and cancer. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional survey was completed by participants attending Australian Salvation Army residential substance abuse treatment services (n = 228). Rates of smoking, exercise, dietary fat intake, body mass index and depression were identified and compared with representative community populations. The relationship between length of treatment and changes in these variables was also examined. Results. When compared with the Australian population, participants were much more likely to be current smokers. They also showed higher rates of dietary fat intake, and having had a previous diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Encouragingly, participants were more likely to be engaging in regular exercise. Over a third of all smokers reported having increased their smoking since attending the residential program, with correlational analysis suggesting that nicotine dependence was increasing the longer participants were in treatment. Discussion and Conclusions. People attending substance abuse treatment show extremely high rates of smoking (77%). With the large majority of participants showing multiple risk factors for CVD, it is important that residential services consider strategies to address smoking and the other potentially modifiable health risk factors in an integrated fashion.[Kelly PJ, Baker AL, Deane FP, Kay-Lambkin FJ, Bonevski B, Tregarthen J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pragmatic Precision Psychiatry—A New Direction for Optimizing Treatment Selection;,citation_abstract=Clinical trials have identified numerous prescriptive predictors of mental disorder treatment response, ie, predictors of which treatments are best for which patients. However, none of these prescriptive predictors is strong enough alone to guide precision treatment planning. This has prompted growing interest in developing precision treatment rules (PTRs) that combine information across multiple prescriptive predictors, but this work has been much less successful in psychiatry than some other areas of medicine. Study designs and analysis schemes used in research on PTR development in other areas of medicine are reviewed, key challenges for implementing similar studies of mental disorders are highlighted, and recent methodological advances to address these challenges are described here.Discovering prescriptive predictors requires large samples. Three approaches have been used in other areas of medicine to do this: conduct very large randomized clinical trials, pool individual-level results across multiple smaller randomized clinical trials, and develop preliminary PTRs in large observational treatment samples that are then tested in smaller randomized clinical trials. The third approach is most feasible for research on mental disorders. This approach requires working with large real-world observational electronic health record databases; carefully selecting samples to emulate trials; extracting information about prescriptive predictors from electronic health records along with other inexpensive data augmentation strategies; estimating preliminary PTRs in the observational data using appropriate methods; implementing pragmatic trials to validate the preliminary PTRs; and iterating between subsequent observational studies and quality improvement pragmatic trials to refine and expand the PTRs. New statistical methods exist to address the methodological challenges of implementing this approach.Advances in pragmatic precision psychiatry will require moving beyond the current focus on randomized clinical trials and adopting an iterative discovery-confirmation process that integrates observational and experimental studies in real-world clinical populations.;,citation_author=Ronald C.

It is not known how often commercially insured adults obtain follow-up treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose.To investigate the incidence of follow-up treatment following emergency department discharge after nonfatal opioid overdose and patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims database for a large US commercial insurer, from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2019, to September 26, 2019. Adult patients discharged from the emergency department after an index opioid overdose (no overdose in the preceding 90 days) were included. Patients with cancer and without continuous insurance enrollment were excluded.The primary outcome was follow-up treatment in the 90 days following overdose, defined as a combined outcome of claims for treatment encounters or medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine and naltrexone). Analysis was stratified by whether patients received treatment for opioid use disorder in the 90 days before the overdose. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment. Marginal effects were used to report the average adjusted probability and absolute risk differences (ARDs) in follow-up for different patient characteristics.A total of 6451 patients were identified with nonfatal opioid overdose; the mean (SD) age was 45.0 (19.3) years, 3267 were women (50.6%), and 4676 patients (72.5%) reported their race as non-Hispanic white. A total of 1069 patients (16.6%; 95% CI, 15.7%-17.5%) obtained follow-up treatment within 90 days after the overdose. In adjusted analysis of patients who did not receive treatment before the overdose, black patients were half as likely to obtain follow-up compared with non-Hispanic white patients (ARD, -5.9%; 95% CI, -8.6% to -3.6%). Women (ARD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -3.3% to -0.5%) and Hispanic patients (ARD, -3.5%; 95% CI, -6.1% to -0.9%) were also less likely to obtain follow-up. For each additional year of age, patients were 0.2% less likely to obtain follow-up (95% CI, -0.3% to -0.1%).Efforts to improve the low rate of timely follow-up treatment following opioid overdose may seek to address sex, race/ethnicity, and age disparities.;,citation_author=Austin S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Short Inventory of Problems – Revised (SIP-R): Psychometric properties within a large, diverse sample of substance use disorder treatment seekers;,citation_abstract=Assessment of the adverse consequences of substance use serves an important function in both clinical and research settings, yet there is no universally agreed upon measure of consequences relevant to multiple types of substance use disorders. One of the most commonly used measures, the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP), has been adapted and evaluated in several specific populations, but evidence of its reliability and validity across broader samples of persons with substance use disorders is needed. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a revised version of the SIP (SIP-R) in a large combined sample of alcohol and drug use disorder treatment-seekers, with participants pooled from two national, multisite randomized clinical trials. A total of 886 participants across 10 outpatient treatment facilities completed a common assessment battery that included the SIP-R, Addiction Severity Index (ASI), University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), HIV Risk Behavior Scale (HRBS), and a substance use calendar. Results supported the SIP-R’s internal reliability ($\alpha$=.95). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the hypothesized 5-factor model with one higher-order factor produced the best fit. Convergent validity was evident through the SIP-R’s correlation with several composite scores from the ASI and the URICA, and analyses supported its conceptual distinction from quantity indices of drug/alcohol use. The SIP-R also demonstrated an ability to predict treatment retention, with higher scores associated with poorer retention. These results provide support for the SIP-R’s psychometric properties as a measure of consequences across a broad sample of treatment-seeking drug and alcohol users.;,citation_author=Brian D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detecting recovery problems just in time: Application of automated linguistic analysis and supervised machine learning to an online substance abuse forum;,citation_abstract=Background: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or “moderators”) may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. Objective: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. Methods: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. Results: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (“drink,” “relapse,” “depression,” and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery. Conclusions: Differences in language use can distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive issues.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Precision medicine and pharmacogenetics: What does oncology have that addiction medicine does not?;,citation_abstract=Background and aims Precision, personalized or stratified medicine, which promises to deliver the right treatment to the right patient, is a topic of international interest in both the lay press and the scientific literature. A key aspect of precision medicine is the identification of biomarkers that predict the response to medications (i.e. pharmacogenetics). We examined why, despite the great strides that have been made in biomarker identification in many areas of medicine, only in oncology has there been substantial progress in their clinical implementation. We also considered why progress in this effort has lagged in addiction medicine. Methods We compared the development of pharmacogenetic biomarkers in oncology, cardiovascular medicine (where developments are also promising) and addictive disorders. Results The first major reason for the success of oncologic pharmacogenetics is ready access to tumor tissue, which allows in-vitro testing and insights into cancer biology. The second major reason is funding, with cancer research receiving, by far, the largest allocation by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) during the past two decades. The second largest allocation of research funding has gone to cardiovascular disease research. Addictions research received a much smaller NIH funding allocation, despite the major impact that tobacco use, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use have on the public health and healthcare costs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The PHQ-9: Validity of a brief depression severity measure;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &amp;amp;amp;quot;0&amp;quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score $&amp;gt;$ or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cross-validation pitfalls when selecting and assessing regression and classification models;,citation_abstract=Background We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. Methods We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. Results We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. Conclusions We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.

The aim of this study is to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of smoking cessation. Data was acquired from patients underwent smoking cessation program at one medical center in Northern Taiwan. A total of 4875 enrollments fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Models with artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and naïve Bayes (NB) were trained to predict the final smoking status of the patients in a six-month period. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC or ROC value) were used to determine the performance of the models.

An Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline;,citation_abstract=Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely confront treatment teams. Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations. Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.;,citation_author=Frank T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of the nicotine metabolite ratio as a genetically informed biomarker of response to nicotine patch or varenicline for smoking cessation: A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Substantial variability exists in therapeutic response and adverse effects with pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence. Biomarkers to optimise treatment choice for individual smokers might improve treatment outcomes. We tested whether a genetically informed biomarker of nicotine clearance, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3’-hydroxycotinine:cotinine), predicts response to nicotine patch or varenicline for smoking cessation. METHODS: We undertook NMR-stratified multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial from Nov 16, 2010, to Sept 12, 2014, at four sites. Smokers seeking treatment were randomly assigned by baseline NMR status and study site, in blocks of 12 patients (1:1:1 ratio), to 11 weeks of placebo (placebo pill plus placebo patch), nicotine patch (active patch plus placebo pill), or varenicline (active pill plus placebo patch), plus behavioural counselling. Participants and investigators were masked to group allocation and NMR status. An intention-to-treat analysis was done. Participants were followed up for 12 months after the target quit date. The primary endpoint was biochemically verified 7 day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment to estimate the pharmacological effect of treatment by NMR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01314001. FINDINGS: 1246 participants (662 slow metabolisers of nicotine, 584 normal metabolisers of nicotine) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three interventions (408 placebo, 418 nicotine patch, 420 varenicline). At end of treatment, varenicline was more efficacious than nicotine patch in normal metabolisers (OR 2$\cdot$17, 95% CI 1$\cdot$38-3$\cdot$42; p=0$\cdot$001), but not in slow metabolisers (OR 1$\cdot$13, 0$\cdot$74-1$\cdot$71; p=0$\cdot$56). In the longitudinal model including all timepoints, the NMR-by-treatment interaction was significant (ratio of odds ratios [ORR] 1$\cdot$96, 95% CI 1$\cdot$11-3$\cdot$46; p=0$\cdot$02). An NMR-by-treatment interaction showed that slow (vs normal) metabolisers reported greater overall side-effect severity with varenicline versus placebo ($\beta$=-1$\cdot$06, 95% CI -2$\cdot$08 to -0$\cdot$03; p=0$\cdot$044). INTERPRETATION: Treating normal metabolisers with varenicline and slow metabolisers with nicotine patch could optimise quit rates while minimising side-effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

ADHD is more prevalent in patients with substance use disorders, and this pattern is consistent across different substances of abuse. Individuals with SUDs and ADHD exhibit significant variations in their clinical presentations. The developmental trajectory of ADHD to SUDs is complex: ADHD symptoms appear first in some patients but not in others. Many patients present with a heterogeneous collection of psychiatric and substance use co-morbidities, and these symptoms change over time. ADHD symptom severity is also highly variable, and more severe ADHD symptoms worsen co-morbid SUDs and complicate treatment. New longitudinal studies with innovative methods in high-risk populations and in community-based samples may clarify issues related to patient-treatment matching. When closely monitored, psychostimulant and other adjunct medications can be safely used to treat ADHD in this population, and such treatment may also improve outcome of SUDs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning for precision medicine;,citation_abstract=Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine’s multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Applicability of machine learning algorithm to predict the therapeutic intervention success in Brazilian smokers;,citation_abstract=Smoking cessation is an important public health policy worldwide. However, as far as we know, there is a lack of screening of variables related to the success of therapeutic intervention (STI) in Brazilian smokers by machine learning (ML) algorithms. To address this gap in the literature, we evaluated the ability of eight ML algorithms to correctly predict the STI in Brazilian smokers who were treated at a smoking cessation program in Brazil between 2006 and 2017. The dataset was composed of 12 variables and the efficacies of the algorithms were measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We plotted a decision tree flowchart and also measured the odds ratio (OR) between each independent variable and the outcome, and the importance of the variable for the best model based on PPV. The mean global values for the metrics described above were, respectively, 0.6750.028, 0.8030.078, 0.4850.146, 0.7050.035 and 0.6800.033. Supporting vector machines performed the best algorithm with a PPV of 0.7260.031. Smoking cessation drug use was the roof of decision tree with OR of 4.42 and importance of variable of 100.00. Increase in the number of relapses also promoted a positive outcome, while higher consumption of cigarettes resulted in the opposite. In summary, the best model predicted 72.6% of positive outcomes correctly. Smoking cessation drug use and higher number of relapses contributed to quit smoking, while higher consumption of cigarettes showed the opposite effect. There are important strategies to reduce the number of smokers and increase STI by increasing services and drug treatment for smokers.;,citation_author=Miyoko Massago;,citation_author=Mamoru Massago;,citation_author=Pedro Henrique Iora;,citation_author=Sanderland José Tavares Gurgel;,citation_author=Celso Ivam Conegero;,citation_author=Idalina Diair Regla Carolino;,citation_author=Maria Muzanila Mushi;,citation_author=Giane Aparecida Chaves Forato;,citation_author=João Vitor Perez Souza;,citation_author=Thiago Augusto Hernandes Rocha;,citation_author=Samile Bonfim;,citation_author=Catherine Ann Staton;,citation_author=Oscar Kenji Nihei;,citation_author=João Ricardo Nickenig Vissoci;,citation_author=Luciano Andrade;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0295970;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=38437221;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS One;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Successful classification of cocaine dependence using brain imaging: A generalizable machine learning approach;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have yielded significant advances in the understanding of neural processes relevant to the development and persistence of addiction. However, these advances have not explored extensively for diagnostic accuracy in human subjects. The aim of this study was to develop a statistical approach, using a machine learning framework, to correctly classify brain images of cocaine-dependent participants and healthy controls. In this study, a framework suitable for educing potential brain regions that differed between the two groups was developed and implemented. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) images obtained during rest or a saline infusion in three cohorts of 2-4 week abstinent cocaine-dependent participants (n = 93) and healthy controls (n = 69) were used to develop a classification model. An information theoretic-based feature selection algorithm was first conducted to reduce the number of voxels. A density-based clustering algorithm was then used to form spatially connected voxel clouds in three-dimensional space. A statistical classifier, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), was then used for participant classification. Statistically insignificant voxels of spatially connected brain regions were removed iteratively and classification accuracy was reported through the iterations. RESULTS: The voxel-based analysis identified 1,500 spatially connected voxels in 30 distinct clusters after a grid search in SVM parameters. Participants were successfully classified with 0.88 and 0.89&nbsp;F-measure accuracies in 10-fold cross validation (10xCV) and leave-one-out (LOO) approaches, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.90 and 0.89 for LOO; 0.83 and 0.83 for 10xCV. Many of the 30 selected clusters are highly relevant to the addictive process, including regions relevant to cognitive control, default mode network related self-referential thought, behavioral inhibition, and contextual memories. Relative hyperactivity and hypoactivity of regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions in cocaine-dependent participants are presented with corresponding level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: The SVM-based approach successfully classified cocaine-dependent and healthy control participants using voxels selected with information theoretic-based and statistical methods from participants’ SPECT data. The regions found in this study align with brain regions reported in the literature. These findings support the future use of brain imaging and SVM-based classifier in the diagnosis of substance use disorders and furthering an understanding of their underlying pathology.;,citation_author=Mutlu Mete;,citation_author=Unal Sakoglu;,citation_author=Jeffrey S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting population health with machine learning: A scoping review;,citation_abstract=Objective To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. Design A scoping review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. Eligibility criteria We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. Data extraction and synthesis We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. Results Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). Conclusions Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using the Berlin Questionnaire to identify patients at risk for the sleep apnea syndrome;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Although sleep apnea is common, it often goes undiagnosed in primary care encounters. OBJECTIVE: To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. DESIGN: Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. SETTING: Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. PATIENTS: 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. MEASUREMENTS: Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). RESULTS: Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Healthcare coverage and service access for low-income adults with substance use disorders;,citation_abstract=Introduction Although health coverage facilitates service access to adults in the general population, uncertainty exists over the extent to which this relationship extends to low-income adults with substance use disorders. Methods The health status and service use patterns of low-income adults with substance use disorders who had continuous, discontinuous, and no past year health coverage were compared using data from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population. Results In the weighted sample (unweighted n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9243), approximately 65.66% of low-income adults with substance use disorders had continuous coverage, 17.03% had discontinuous coverage, and 17.31% had no insurance coverage during the past year. Although few group differences were observed in self-reported health status, the uninsured group compared to the discontinously and continuously covered groups, respectively, was less likely to report a past year substance use treatment visit (11.03% vs. 14.83% vs. 15.61%), an outpatient care visit (53.39% vs. 71.27% vs. 79.04%), an emergency department visit (33.33% vs. 45.76% vs. 45.57%), or an inpatient admission (9.24% vs. 15.11% vs. 15.58%). Conclusions Although the cross sectional design limits causal inferences, the correlations between lacking health insurance and low rates of substance use treatment and healthcare use raise the possibility that increasing healthcare coverage might increase access to substance use treatment and other needed healthcare services for low-income adults with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Mark Olfson;,citation_author=Christine Mauro;,citation_author=Melanie M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations, Small-Molecule Kinase Inhibitors, and Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Current Knowledge and Future Directions;,citation_abstract=Purpose Gefitinib and erlotinib are small molecules that selectively inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity. When these drugs were introduced into the clinic, the specific targets affected in human tumors were unknown. In April 2004, two groups reported that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are strongly associated with gefitinib sensitivity in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We subsequently extended these findings and showed that such mutations are also associated with sensitivity to erlotinib. Here, we present current knowledge about EGFR mutations in the context of clinical trials involving gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC. Design This article reviews the rationale for targeting EGFR, the development of gefitinib and erlotinib, the discovery of EGFR mutations, and subsequent studies to define the incidence, spectrum, and functions of EGFR mutations.

By employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in predicting smoking status.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Quitting Rollercoaster: How Recent Quitting History Affects Future Cessation Outcomes (Data From the International Tobacco Control 4-Country Cohort Study);,citation_abstract=Most smokers have a history of unsuccessful quit attempts. This study used data from 7 waves (2002–2009) of the International Tobacco Control 4-country cohort study to examine the role of smokers’ quitting history (e.g., recency, length, and number of previous quit attempts) on their subsequent likelihood of making a quit attempt and achieving at least 6 months of sustained abstinence.Generalized estimating equations were used, allowing for estimation of relationships between variables across repeated observations while controlling for correlations from multiple responses by the same individual (29,682 observations from 13,417 individuals).The likelihood of a future quit attempt increased independently with recency and number of prior attempts. By contrast, the likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence of at least 6 months was reduced for smokers with a failed quit attempt within the last year (15.1% vs. 27.1% for those without, p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001). Two or more failed attempts (vs. only one) in the previous year were also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.85). Effects persisted after controlling for levels of addiction, self-efficacy to quit, and use of stop-smoking medications.There appears to be a subset of smokers who repeatedly attempt but fail to remain abstinent from tobacco.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classification of Lapses in Smokers Attempting to Stop: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach Using Data From a Popular Smoking Cessation Smartphone App;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Smoking lapses after the quit date often lead to full relapse. To inform the development of real time, tailored lapse prevention support, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports. AIMS AND METHODS: We used data from app users with $\geq$20 unprompted data entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (eg, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample (1) observations and (2) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested. RESULTS: Participants (N = 791) provided 37 002 data entries (7.6% lapses). The best-performing group-level algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.961 to 0.978). Its ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample individuals ranged from poor to excellent (AUC = 0.482-1.000). Individual-level algorithms could be constructed for 39/791 participants with sufficient data, with a median AUC of 0.938 (range: 0.518-1.000). Hybrid algorithms could be constructed for 184/791 participants and had a median AUC of 0.825 (range: 0.375-1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual’s dataset, in addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of each individual’s data, had improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. IMPLICATIONS: This study used routinely collected data from a popular smartphone app to train and test a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse events. Although a high-performing group-level algorithm was developed, it had variable performance when applied to new, unseen individuals. Individual-level and hybrid algorithms had somewhat greater performance but could not be constructed for all participants because of the lack of variability in the outcome measure. Triangulation of results with those from a prompted study design is recommended prior to intervention development, with real-world lapse prediction likely requiring a balance between unprompted and prompted app data.;,citation_author=Olga Perski;,citation_author=Kezhi Li;,citation_author=Nikolas Pontikos;,citation_author=David Simons;,citation_author=Stephanie P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A current re-examination of racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment: Do disparities persist?;,citation_abstract=Objective Racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment services have been documented. The objective of this study was to re-examine if racial/ethnic disparities in the use of treatment still exist using current data collected post-implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Methods Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n = 12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity. Results Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 637 adult smokers (55% women, 88% white) motivated to quit smoking who visited primary care clinics. INTERVENTIONS: Six intervention components designed to prepare smokers to quit, and achieve and maintain abstinence (i.e. for the preparation, cessation and maintenance phases of smoking treatment): (1) preparation nicotine patch versus none; (2) preparation nicotine gum versus none; (3) preparation counseling versus none; (4) intensive cessation in-person counseling versus minimal; (5) intensive cessation telephone counseling versus minimal; and (6) 16 versus 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch  +  nicotine gum).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward precision smoking cessation treatment II: Proximal effects of smoking cessation intervention components on putative mechanisms of action;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Understanding how smoking cessation treatments exert their effects can inform treatment development and use. Factorial designs allow researchers to examine whether multiple intervention components affect hypothesized change mechanisms, and whether the affected mechanisms are related to cessation. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of smokers recruited during primary care visits (N=637, 55% women, 87% white) who were motivated to quit. Participants in this fractional factorial experiment were randomized to one level of each of six intervention factors: Prequit Nicotine Patch vs None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs None, Preparation Counseling vs None, Intensive In-Person Counseling vs Minimal, Intensive Phone Counseling vs Minimal, and 16 vs 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement (nicotine patch+nicotine gum). Data on putative mechanisms (e.g., medication use, withdrawal, self-efficacy) and smoking status were gathered using daily assessments and during follow-up assessment calls. RESULTS: Some intervention components influenced hypothesized mechanisms. Prequit Gum and Patch each reduced prequit smoking and enhanced prequit coping and self-efficacy. In-Person Counseling increased prequit motivation to quit, postquit self-efficacy, and postquit perceived intratreatment support. Withdrawal reduction and reduced prequit smoking produced the strongest effects on cessation. The significant effect of combining Prequit Gum and In-Person Counseling on 26-week abstinence was mediated by increased prequit self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This factorial experiment identified which putative treatment mechanisms were influenced by discrete intervention components and which mechanisms influenced cessation. Such information supports the combined use of prequit nicotine gum and intensive in-person counseling as cessation interventions that operate via increased prequit self-efficacy.;,citation_author=Megan E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward precision smoking cessation treatment I: Moderator results from a factorial experiment;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: The development of tobacco use treatments that are effective for all smokers is critical to improving clinical and public health. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate multiple intervention components for possible inclusion in an optimized tobacco use treatment. Factorial experiments permit analyses of the influence of patient characteristics on main and interaction effects of multiple, relatively discrete, intervention components. This study examined whether person-factor and smoking characteristics moderated the main or interactive effects of intervention components on 26-week self-reported abstinence rates. METHODS: This fractional factorial experiment evaluated six smoking cessation intervention components among primary care patients (N=637): Prequit Nicotine Patch vs. None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs. None, Preparation Counseling vs. None, Intensive Cessation In-Person Counseling vs. Minimal, Intensive Cessation Telephone Counseling vs. Minimal, and 16 vs. 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT; nicotine patch+nicotine gum). RESULTS: Both psychiatric history and smoking heaviness moderated intervention component effects. In comparison with participants with no self-reported history of a psychiatric disorder, those with a positive history showed better response to 16- vs. 8-weeks of combination NRT, but a poorer response to counseling interventions. Also, in contrast to light smokers, heavier smokers showed a poorer response to counseling interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy smokers and those with psychiatric histories demonstrated a differential response to intervention components.

It focuses on (1) the main effects of the three Project MATCH treatments, (2) the prognostic value of client attributes employed in the matching hypotheses, and (3) the attribute by treatment interaction effects. METHOD: Clients recruited from outpatient settings (n = 952) or from aftercare settings (n = 774) were randomized to one of the following treatments: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Alcohol consumption and psychosocial functioning during treatment were assessed at the end of the 12-week treatment phase. RESULTS: During the treatment phase, small but statistically significant differences among treatments were found only in the outpatient arm on measures of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Forty-one percent (41%) of CBT and TSF clients were abstinent or drank moderately without alcohol-related consequences, compared with 28% of MET clients. Tests of 10 a priori primary client-treatment matching hypotheses failed to find any interaction effects that had an impact on drinking throughout the treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: In the outpatient setting there appears to be a temporary advantage to assigning individuals to CBT or TSF rather than MET.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment of Tobacco Smoking: A Review;,citation_abstract=More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician’s brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.;,citation_author=Nancy A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reasons and clinical outcomes of antipsychotic treatment switch in outpatients with schizophrenia in real-life clinical settings: The ETOS observational study;,citation_abstract=Background Patients under antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia commonly exhibit poor adherence to treatment, high rates of treatment discontinuation, and frequent treatment changes. The ETOS study aimed to identify the reasons leading physicians to decide to switch antipsychotic treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia and to evaluate the outcome of this switch. Methods ETOS was an observational 18-week (four visits) study in outpatients 18 to 65&nbsp;years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition criteria at least 6&nbsp;months prior to enrolment, who were initiated on a new antipsychotic monotherapy treatment within the 2&nbsp;weeks prior to enrollment. A total of 574 patients were recruited by 87 hospital- and office-based physicians. Ethical approval was obtained prior to study initiation (NCT00999895). Results The final analysis included 568 patients, 39.0  11.2&nbsp;years old with mean disease duration of 11.7&nbsp;years. The male-to-female ratio was 53:47. The main reason for switching antipsychotic treatment was lack of tolerability (n = 369, 65.0%), followed by lack of efficacy (n = 249, 43.8%). Following treatment switch, 87.9% of patients (n = 499) showed meaningful clinical benefit by achieving a Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit score of $\leq$4 at the final visit. By the end of the study, total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, Clinical Global Impression-Severity, and Simpson-Angus Scale scores demonstrated significant mean decreases of 31.69, 0.70, 1.14, and 11.30, respectively (all p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.0001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interventions for Tobacco Smoking;,citation_abstract=Around 19% of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, and smoking remains the leading avoidable cause of death in this country. Without treatment only ~5% of smokers who try to quit achieve long-term abstinence, but evidence-based cessation treatment increases this figure to 10-30%. The process of smoking cessation comprises different pragmatically defined phases, and these can help guide smoking treatment development and evaluation. This review evaluates the effectiveness of smoking interventions for smokers who are unwilling to make a quit attempt (Motivation Phase), who are willing to make a quit attempt (Cessation Phase), who have recently quit (Maintenance Phase), and who have recently relapsed (Relapse Recovery Phase). Multiple effective treatments exist for some phases (Cessation), but not others (Relapse Recovery). A chronic care approach to treating smoking requires effective interventions for every phase, especially interventions that exert complementary effects both within and across phases, and that can be disseminated broadly and cost-effectively.;,citation_author=Tanya R.

A prospective study;,citation_abstract=Background and aims In smoking treatment trials comparing varenicline with transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), stratified by nicotine metabolite (3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) ratio (NMR), the relative benefit of varenicline is greater among normal rather than slow metabolizers. This study tested if the relative effectiveness of varenicline and NRT is associated with NMR status in a natural treatment setting. A secondary aim was to test if this relationship is moderated by behavioural support. Design Prospective observational multi-centre study with 4-week and 52-week follow-up. Setting Nine English Stop Smoking Services (SSS). Participants Data came from 1556 smokers (aged $\geq$ 16 years) attending SSS between March 2012 and March 2013. Interventions Participants received pharmacotherapy together with behavioural support. Measurements The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence at both follow-up times. Main explanatory variables were (1) NMR status [slow (NMR $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.31, n = 451) versus normal (NMR $\geq$ 0.31, n = 1105) metabolizers]; (2) pharmacotherapy (varenicline versus NRT) and (3) behavioural support (individual versus group-based treatment). Analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic, SSS, mental/physical health and smoking characteristics. Findings Of participants, 44.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.7–46.6%] and 8.0% (95% CI = 6.8–9.5%) were continuously abstinent at 4 and 52 weeks. Varenicline was more effective than NRT at 4 weeks (P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) but only marginally so at 52 weeks (P = 0.061). There was no or inclusive evidence that NMR status moderated relative efficacy of varenicline and NRT at 4- [P = 0.60, Bayes factor (BF) = 0.25] or 52-week follow-ups (P = 0.74, BF = 0.73). However, this relationship was moderated by behavioural support (p = 0.012): the relative benefit of varenicline over NRT at 52-week follow-up was greater in slow, not normal, metabolizers receiving group rather than individual support (P = 0.012).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Use of the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio as a Biomarker to Personalize Smoking Cessation Treatment: Current Evidence and Future Directions;,citation_abstract=The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a genetically informed biomarker of rate of nicotine metabolism, has been validated as a tool to select the optimal treatment for individual smokers, thereby improving treatment outcomes. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the development of the NMR as a biomarker of individual differences in nicotine metabolism, the relationship between the NMR and smoking behavior, the clinical utility of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation, and the potential mechanisms that underlie the relationship between NMR and smoking cessation. We conclude with a call for additional research necessary to determine the ultimate benefits of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation. These future directions include measurement and other methodologic considerations, disseminating this approach to at-risk subpopulations, expanding the NMR to evaluate its efficacy in predicting treatment responses to e-cigarettes and other noncigarette forms of nicotine, and implementation science including cost-effectiveness analyses.See all articles in this Special Collection Honoring Paul F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development of the Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION The 68-item Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68) is a theoretically derived measure of tobacco dependence consisting of 13 subscales measuring a variety of smoking motives. The WISDM-68 subscales have demonstrated good psychometric characteristics and have the potential to elucidate diverse nicotine dependence factors and mechanisms. The present research aimed to shorten the WISDM to reduce assessment burden while maintaining or enhancing its psychometric properties. METHODS Data from three independent samples (one longitudinal observational study and two randomized clinical trials) were used to select subscales and reduced sets of items in order to develop and test a brief version of the WISDM-68. The full-item and reduced-item versions of the WISDM were then compared in terms of reliability, validity, and model fit (via confirmatory factor analysis) in the three independent samples. RESULTS Thirty-one items were dropped from the WISDM, the Behavioral Choice-Melioration subscale was dropped, and the Negative and Positive Reinforcement subscales were consolidated. This resulted in a new WISDM short form (Brief WISDM) comprising 37 items that load onto 11 subscales. The psychometric properties of the reduced-item WISDM subscales were found to be comparable with the full-item subscales in terms of internal consistency, long-term stability, concurrent validity, predictive validity, and model fit. DISCUSSION These analyses provide good evidence that the 37-item Brief WISDM can be used in place of the original 68-item WISDM if researchers desire to reduce participant assessment burden.;,citation_author=Stevens S Smith;,citation_author=Megan E Piper;,citation_author=Daniel M Bolt;,citation_author=Michael C Fiore;,citation_author=David W Wetter;,citation_author=Paul M Cinciripini;,citation_author=Timothy B Baker;,citation_publication_date=2010-05;,citation_cover_date=2010-05;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20231242;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1093/ntr/ntq032;,citation_issn=1469-994X;,citation_pmid=20231242;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Nicotine &amp;amp;amp; Tobacco Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Revision of the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale: Development of Brief and Long Forms;,citation_abstract=The assessment of tobacco withdrawal is important for both research and clinical purposes. This study describes the psychometric development of a revised version of the 28-item Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS; ). Because the different contexts of use sometimes permit only brief assessment, this revision has produced both a brief and longer form using an updated pool of candidate items. For the revised WSWS2, a candidate pool of 37 items was developed to measure nine putative withdrawal constructs. The stem and wording of items were revised as was the response scale. Data for psychometric analyses were derived from three smoking cessation randomized clinical trials conducted at the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention. Dimensionality, internal consistency, and item characteristic analyses of the candidate items were conducted in a derivation sample to ascertain the factor structure and to identify items that could be used in the WSWS2 scales. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) of reduced item sets and factor structure were conducted in two validation samples along with reliability and validity analyses. Derivation and validation sample analyses yielded a longer version of the WSWS2 (WSWS2-L) with 19 items and six subscales (Craving, Negative Affect, Hunger, Sleep, Restlessness, and Concentration) and a brief 6-item version (WSWS2-B). In validation sample analyses, both the WSWS2-L and the WSWS2-B demonstrated good reliability and validity as well as good fit in CFAs.

Data sources included electronic academic databases. Search terms: “smoking” AND “homeless” AND “tobacco”, including adult (18+ years) smokers accessing homeless support services.ResultsFifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 46 USA). Data could not be meta-analysed due to large methodological inconsistencies and the lack of randomised controlled trials. Smoking prevalence ranged from 57% to 82%. Although there was no clear evidence on which cessation methods work best, layered approaches with additions to usual care seemed to offer modest enhancements in quit rates. Key barriers to cessation exist around the priority of smoking, beliefs around negative impact on mental health and substance use, and environmental influences.ConclusionsHomeless smokers will benefit from layered interventions which support many of their competing needs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pooled and person-specific machine learning models for predicting future alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink: A demonstration of parallel utility;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The specific factors driving alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink, are likely different for different people. The present study sought to apply statistical classification methods to idiographic time series data in order to identify person-specific predictors of future drinking-relevant behavior, affect, and cognitions in a college student sample. DESIGN: Participants were sent 8 mobile phone surveys per day for 15 days. Each survey assessed the number of drinks consumed since the previous survey, as well as positive affect, negative affect, alcohol craving, drinking expectancies, perceived alcohol consumption norms, impulsivity, and social and situational context. Each individual’s data were split into training and testing sets, so that trained models could be validated using person-specific out-of-sample data. Elastic net regularization was used to select a subset of a set of 40 variables to be used to predict either alcohol consumption, craving, or wanting to drink, forward in time. SETTING: A west-coast university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three university students who had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. MEASUREMENTS: Mobile phone surveys. FINDINGS: Averaging across participants, accurate out-of-sample predictions of future drinking were made 76% of the time. For craving, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. For wanting to drink, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. CONCLUSION: Using a person-specific constellation of psychosocial and temporal variables, it may be possible to accurately predict drinking behavior, affect, and cognitions before they occur.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine Learning of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Network Connectivity Predicts Substance Abuse Treatment Completion;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Successfully treating illicit drug use has become paramount, yet elusive. Devising specialized treatment interventions could increase positive outcomes, but it is necessary to identify risk factors of poor long-term outcomes to develop specialized, efficacious treatments. We investigated whether functional network connectivity (FNC) measures were predictive of substance abuse treatment completion using machine learning pattern classification of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. METHODS: Treatment-seeking stimulant- or heroin-dependent incarcerated participants (n&nbsp;= 139; 89 women) volunteered for a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. Participants performed a response inhibition Go/NoGo functional magnetic resonance imaging task prior to onset of the substance abuse treatment. We tested whether FNC related to the anterior cingulate cortex would be predictive of those who would or would not complete a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. RESULTS: Machine learning pattern classification models using FNC between networks incorporating the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula predicted which individuals would (sensitivity: 81.31%) or would not (specificity: 78.13%) complete substance abuse treatment. FNC analyses predicted treatment completion above and beyond other clinical assessment measures, including age, sex, IQ, years of substance use, psychopathy, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and motivation for change. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant neural network connections predicted substance abuse treatment outcomes, which could illuminate new targets for developing interventions designed to reduce or eliminate substance use while facilitating long-term outcomes. This work represents the first application of machine-learning models of FNC analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to predict which substance abusers would or would not complete treatment.;,citation_author=Vaughn R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Robust dimensions of anxiety sensitivity: Development and initial validation of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3;,citation_abstract=Accumulating evidence suggests that anxiety sensitivity (fear of arousal-related sensations) plays an important role in many clinical conditions, particularly anxiety disorders. Research has increasingly focused on how the basic dimensions of anxiety sensitivity are related to various forms of psychopathology. Such work has been hampered because the original measure–the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)–was not designed to be multidimensional. Subsequently developed multidimensional measures have unstable factor structures or measure only a subset of the most widely replicated factors. Therefore, the authors developed, via factor analysis of responses from U.S. and Canadian nonclinical participants (n=2,361), an 18-item measure, the ASI-3, which assesses the 3 factors best replicated in previous research: Physical, Cognitive, and Social Concerns. Factorial validity of the ASI-3 was supported by confirmatory factor analyses of 6 replication samples, including nonclinical samples from the United States and Canada, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain (n=4,494) and a clinical sample from the United States and Canada (n=390). The ASI-3 displayed generally good performance on other indices of reliability and validity, along with evidence of improved psychometric properties over the original ASI.;,citation_author=Steven Taylor;,citation_author=Michael J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalizing substance use treatment based on pre-treatment impulsivity and sensation seeking: A review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Theoretically, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment that matches an individual’s etiology and/or maintaining factors should be more effective than a treatment that does not directly address these factors. Impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking may contribute to the development and maintenance of SUDs, and are potential candidate variables for assigning patients to treatment. The goal is to identify whether current research can provide insight into which treatments may be most effective for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking, relative to other treatments. A secondary goal is to provide recommendations for personalizing SUD treatment based on etiology or maintaining factors. METHOD: This review summarizes clinical trials that speak to the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use disorders, based on pre-treatment impulsivity, sensation seeking, or related constructs. RESULTS: Few studies examine the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking. Very preliminary evidence suggests that contingency management may hold promise for individuals high in impulsivity. Pharmacological trials were under-represented in the current review, despite evidence that the effectiveness of some pharmacological interventions may be moderated by impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Potential reasons for slow rate of progress to date are provided. Given slow accumulation of evidence, an alternative method for personalizing treatment based on pre-treatment psychosocial factors, including impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking, is proposed. Future research may explore the role of contingency management for SUD among individuals with high pre-treatment impulsivity or sensation seeking. Finally, novel, technology-enhanced behavioral mechanisms are discussed as an adjunct to SUD treatment for these high-risk populations.;,citation_author=Rachel L. Tomko;,citation_author=Kaitlin E.

The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance use through its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences between adolescents from two-parent families and those from single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized prediction of antidepressant v. Placebo response: Evidence from the EMBARC study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, it is possible that only certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to antidepressants. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anhedonia, and cognitive control deficits. METHODS: Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Five pre-treatment variables moderated treatment response. Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations of a 10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31% of the sample would exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with sertraline relative to placebo. Although there were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can be identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model must be tested prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment selection. However, findings demonstrate the potential to improve individual outcomes through algorithm-guided treatment recommendations.;,citation_author=Christian A. Webb;,citation_author=Madhukar H.

Tracking Trends Over Time for Youth Anxiety, Depression, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Conduct Problems;,citation_abstract=With the development of empirically supported treatments over the decades, have youth psychotherapies grown stronger? To investigate, we examined changes over time in treatment effects for four frequently treated youth mental-health problems: anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct disorders. We used PubMed and PsycINFO to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published between January 1960 and May 2017 involving youths between the ages of 4 and 18 years. We also searched reviews and meta-analyses of youth psychotherapy research, followed reference trails in the reports we identified, and obtained additional studies identified by therapy researchers whom we contacted. We identified 453 RCTs (31,933 participants) spanning 53 years (1963-2016). Effect sizes for the problem-relevant outcome measures were synthesized via multilevel meta-analysis. We tracked temporal trends for each problem domain and then examined multiple study characteristics that might moderate those trends. Mean effect size increased nonsignificantly for anxiety, decreased nonsignificantly for ADHD, and decreased significantly for depression and conduct problems. Moderator analyses involving multiple study subgroups showed only a few exceptions to these surprising patterns. The findings suggest that new approaches to treatment design and intervention science may be needed, especially for depression and conduct problems. We suggest intensifying the search for mechanisms of change, making treatments more transdiagnostic and personalizable, embedding treatments within youth ecosystems, adapting treatments to the social and technological changes that alter youth dysfunction and treatment needs, and resisting old habits that can make treatments unduly skeuomorphic.;,citation_author=John R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Global burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs). METHODS: For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country, region, and year. We obtained disability weights from representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from cause of death estimates for 1980-2010 for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and present them with 95% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183$\cdot$9 million DALYs (95% UI 153$\cdot$5 million-216$\cdot$7 million), or 7$\cdot$4% (6$\cdot$2-8$\cdot$6) of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8$\cdot$6 million YLLs (6$\cdot$5 million-12$\cdot$1 million; 0$\cdot$5% [0$\cdot$4-0$\cdot$7] of all YLLs) and 175$\cdot$3 million YLDs (144$\cdot$5 million-207$\cdot$8 million; 22$\cdot$9% [18$\cdot$6-27$\cdot$2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders accounted for 40$\cdot$5% (31$\cdot$7-49$\cdot$2) of DALYs caused by mental and substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for 14$\cdot$6% (11$\cdot$2-18$\cdot$4), illicit drug use disorders for 10$\cdot$9% (8$\cdot$9-13$\cdot$2), alcohol use disorders for 9$\cdot$6% (7$\cdot$7-11$\cdot$8), schizophrenia for 7$\cdot$4% (5$\cdot$0-9$\cdot$8), bipolar disorder for 7$\cdot$0% (4$\cdot$4-10$\cdot$3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4$\cdot$2% (3$\cdot$2-5$\cdot$3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3$\cdot$4% (2$\cdot$2-4$\cdot$7), and eating disorders for 1$\cdot$2% (0$\cdot$9-1$\cdot$5). DALYs varied by age and sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in people aged 10-29 years. The burden of mental and substance use disorders increased by 37$\cdot$6% between 1990 and 2010, which for most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing. INTERPRETATION: Despite the apparently small contribution of YLLs–with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of injuries under self-harm–our findings show the striking and growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of their contribution, improvement in population health is only possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders a public health priority.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Research review: Polygenic methods and their application to psychiatric traits;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the last 5 years. METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing heritability. FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic risk factors.;,citation_author=Naomi R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Stephanie B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Sarah June Kittleson Sant’Ana;,citation_author=Gaylen Fronk;,citation_author=John J.

This intra-individual variability of relevant psychological states combined with the “one day of a time” nature of sustained abstinence warrant a day-to-day investigation of substance use recovery. This study examines day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use among 30 college students in 12-step recovery from drug and alcohol addictions. To account for individual variability in day-to-day process, it applies an idiographic approach.

Data were collected with end-of-day data collections taking place over an average of 26.7 days. First-order vector autoregression models were fit to each individual predicting daily levels of substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use from the same three variables one day prior. Individual model results demonstrated substantial inter-individual differences in intra-individual recovery process. Based on estimates from individual models, cluster analyses were used to group individuals into two homogeneous subgroups. Group comparisons demonstrate distinct patterns in the day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use, suggesting the importance of idiographic approaches to recovery management and that the potential value of focusing on negative affect or tobacco use as prevention targets depends on idiosyncratic processes.;,citation_author=Yao Zheng;,citation_author=Richard P.

        <p>Precision mental health seeks to select the right treatment for a patient given personal characteristics. The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model that could select among first-line medication treatments for cigarette smoking. We used data from a previously completed comparative effectiveness trial in which participants were richly characterized at baseline before being randomly assigned to varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy, or nicotine patch. We built a model predicting treatment success (abstinent vs.&nbsp;smoking) using baseline characteristics and their interactions with treatment. Models were fit, selected, and evaluated using nested cross-validation and the performance metric area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (auROC). Our best models had a median auROC of 0.69 in held-out test sets. We used this model to calculcate probabilities of treatment success for each participant on each of the three treatments to identify their model-predicted best treatment. Individuals who were matched to their model-predicted best treatment during the original trial were more likely to quit successfully at 4 weeks than individuals who were not (OR = 1.382, p = 0.014) but not at later timepoints. This project produces a clinically implementable treatment selection model to assist people quitting cigarette smoking.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Precision medicine seeks to guide and personalize treatment selection using individual difference characteristics that are likely to predict treatment success for each patient <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020">(<a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>)</span>. Successful precision medicine would increase the likelihood of treatment success for each patient because each patient receives the treatment predicted to work best for them. It would also improve treatment effectiveness rates across the population because each treatment is administered only to the patients for whom that treatment is expected to be their best option.</p>
<p>Precision mental health is the application of the precision medicine paradigm to mental health conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019 inselNIMHResearchDomain2014 bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016 bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-inselNIMHResearchDomain2014" role="doc-biblioref">Insel 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman, Lyon, and Wolpert 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>)</span>. Precision mental health models may allow us to select among these treatments to improve mental healthcare. Treatments for mental health conditions are usually no more than moderately effective, and many treatments for the same disorder can be quite comparable <span class="citation" data-cites="lewisPsychologicalTherapiesPosttraumatic2020 weiszArePsychotherapiesYoung2019 adjeiCO110ComparativeEffectiveness2022">(<a href="#ref-lewisPsychologicalTherapiesPosttraumatic2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-weiszArePsychotherapiesYoung2019" role="doc-biblioref">Weisz et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-adjeiCO110ComparativeEffectiveness2022" role="doc-biblioref">Adjei and Ali 2022</a>)</span>. Consequently, many researchers have pursued precision mental health in recent years <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of research, much less progress has been made to personalize treatments for mental health disorders compared to treatments for medical disorders <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016 bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020 kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017 oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017 kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021">(<a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman, Lyon, and Wolpert 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-bickmanImprovingMentalHealth2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-kranzlerPrecisionMedicinePharmacogenetics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Kranzler et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017" role="doc-biblioref">Oliver and McClernon 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kessler and Luedtke 2021</a>)</span>. One possible reason for this is that many factors influence heterogeneous, complex clinical phenomena like mental health diagnoses and treatment success <span class="citation" data-cites="feczkoMethodsChallengesAssessing2020">(<a href="#ref-feczkoMethodsChallengesAssessing2020" role="doc-biblioref">Feczko and Fair 2020</a>)</span>. Thus, any single feature (i.e., predictor variable) cannot account for more than a small portion of the variance in treatment success <span class="citation" data-cites="kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021 inselNIMHResearchDomain2014">(<a href="#ref-kesslerPragmaticPrecisionPsychiatry2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kessler and Luedtke 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-inselNIMHResearchDomain2014" role="doc-biblioref">Insel 2014</a>)</span>. Precision mental health efforts so far, however, have largely focused on personalizing treatments using only a single feature <span class="citation" data-cites="derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019">(<a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>)</span>. It is perhaps unsurprising that models that consider only one or a small handful of features - which also limits considering features from different categories concurrently - have failed to capture the real-world complexity underlying clinical phenomena like treatment success.</p>
<p>Additionally, because models are typically developed and evaluated in the same sample, the models may become very overfit to that sample <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>. This problem is exacerbated in precision mental health because sample sizes in psychological research have remained relatively small despite recommendations to increase sample size <span class="citation" data-cites="marszalekSampleSizePsychological2011">(<a href="#ref-marszalekSampleSizePsychological2011" role="doc-biblioref">Marszalek et al. 2011</a>)</span>. Consequently, precision mental health models rarely generalize well to new patients.</p>
<p>To capture sufficient complexity to predict treatment success, we need to increase the total number of features in precision mental health models. Incorporating more features, however, makes overfitting the data more likely. Thus, successful precision mental health requires an analytic approach that can handle high-dimensional data without becoming too overfit to generalize to new patients.</p>

<p>Combining precision mental health and machine learning may be able to improve treatment for cigarette smoking. Smoking remains an enormous public health burden.

<p>To select among treatments for smoking cessation, precision mental health models must include <em>many features</em> and <em>multiple treatments</em> as inputs. Using a high-dimensional array of features is necessary to predict a complex clinical outcome like treatment success. Including multiple treatments allows for interactions among treatments and features that are needed to make differential predictions by treatment.</p>
<p>There is a large body of research identifying features that predict overall treatment success (i.e., irrespective of treatment) <span class="citation" data-cites="laiDevelopmentMachineLearning2021 kaufmannRateNicotineMetabolism2015 kayeSearchingPersonalizedMedicine2020a piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017a issabakhshMachineLearningApplication2023 etterPredictingSmokingCessation2023">(<a href="#ref-laiDevelopmentMachineLearning2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lai et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-kaufmannRateNicotineMetabolism2015" role="doc-biblioref">Kaufmann et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-kayeSearchingPersonalizedMedicine2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Kaye et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-piperPrecisionSmokingCessation2017a" role="doc-biblioref">Piper, Schlam, et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-issabakhshMachineLearningApplication2023" role="doc-biblioref">Issabakhsh et al. 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-etterPredictingSmokingCessation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Etter, Vera Cruz, and Khazaal 2023</a>)</span> or treatment success when using a single treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="massagoApplicabilityMachineLearning2024 coughlinMachineLearningApproachPredicting2020a">(<a href="#ref-massagoApplicabilityMachineLearning2024" role="doc-biblioref">Massago et al. 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-coughlinMachineLearningApproachPredicting2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Coughlin et al. 2020</a>)</span>.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to evaluate the clinical benefit of a treatment selection model. Specifically, we assessed whether using our model to select among medications for smoking cessation can increase abstinence following quitting smoking. We also assessed whether any treatment benefit is fair such that it performs equitably across demographic groups. To increase confidence in any clinical benefit we observed, we also evaluated model performance (i.e., is there predictive signal?) and interpreted our model (i.e., how does our model work?).</p>

<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>The data for this project came from a completed randomized controlled trial conducted by the University of Wisconsin (UW) Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (CTRI) <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>. This trial compared the effectiveness of three cigarette smoking cessation treatments (varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy [C-NRT], and nicotine patch). Briefly, 1086 adults who smoked cigarettes daily and were looking to quit smoking were enrolled in Madison, WI, USA and Milwaukee, WI, USA. Smoking was biochemically verified. Participants were smoking approximately 17 cigarettes per day (<em>M</em> = 17.03, <em>SD</em> = 8.31) at study enrollment. Exclusion criteria included contraindicated medical (e.g., severe hypertension) or psychiatric (e.g., severe and persistent mental illness) conditions; current use of contraindicated medications; and pregnancy or unwillingness to use contraception while taking a study medication. Participants set a quit date with study staff and were enrolled for several weeks prior to the target quit date through at least 6 months following quitting smoking.</p>
<section id="treatment-conditions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-conditions">Treatment conditions</h4>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three medication conditions: varenicline, C-NRT, or nicotine patch. For varenicline, participants began medication use prior to their quit attempt, starting with 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days, followed by 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days. On the target quit date, participants increased to 1 mg twice daily and continued this dose for 12 weeks except in response to adverse events. For C-NRT or nicotine patch, participants initiated treatment on their quit date. Patch dosing was 8 weeks of 21 mg, 2 weeks of 14 mg, and 2 weeks of 7 mg. All individuals who received C-NRT were also instructed to use at least 5 lozenges per day (2 or 4 mg nicotine lozenges determined by time to first daily cigarette) for the full 12 weeks except in the case of adverse effects.</p>
<p>All participants also received counseling per clinical guidelines <span class="citation" data-cites="fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008">(<a href="#ref-fioreClinicalPracticeGuideline2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fiore et al. 2008</a>)</span>.

Counseling consisted of motivational interviewing/enhancement, supportive therapy, and skill training.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-success-outcome">Treatment success outcome</h4>
<p>Throughout study participation, treatment success was repeatedly assessed via biologically confirmed, 7-day point-prevalence abstinence. Point-prevalence abstinence assesses for any smoking (here, in the previous 7 days) and yields a single, dichotomous outcome of “abstinent” or “smoking.” Participants self-reported whether they had smoked over the past 7 days, and their report was biologically confirmed via exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). Participants were labeled as “abstinent” if their CO level was less than 6 parts per million (ppm; <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>). If participants self-reported any smoking in the past 7 days, their CO level contradicted their self-report (i.e., CO level &gt; 6 ppm), or biological confirmation could not be confirmed, participants were labeled as “smoking.”</p>

<section id="evaluating-clinical-benefit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-clinical-benefit">Evaluating clinical benefit</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this project was to evaluate the clinical benefit of our treatment selection model. In other words, we determined whether using a model to select treatments for individual patients improves clinical outcomes. Details on fitting, selecting, and evaluating model performance of the treatment selection model appear in “Model building, selection, &amp; evaluation.”</p>
<section id="identify-model-predicted-best-treatment" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identify-model-predicted-best-treatment">Identify model-predicted best treatment</h4>
<p>We used our best model configuration (i.e., combination of model characteristics; see Model Building, Selection, &amp; Evaluation) to make treatment success predictions for each participant. Models were fit with 1085 participants, and predictions were made for the remaining, held-out participant. This approach matches real-world implementation in that we made predictions for a new patient the model has not seen.</p>
<p>We calculated three predicted probabilities for each participant by substituting each treatment into the model inputs. This produced one prediction per person per treatment. The treatment that yielded the highest model-predicted probability of abstinence was identified as that participant’s “best” treatment.</p>
<p>For example, an individual received varenicline in the original trial. We calculated their probability of abstinence using their data (i.e., with varenicline as the “treatment” feature), and we calculated two additional probabilities by substituting C-NRT and nicotine patch for varenicline. Their probability of abstinence was highest when substituting C-NRT, meaning C-NRT was identified as their best treatment.</p>
</section>
<section id="categorize-treatment-matching" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="categorize-treatment-matching">Categorize treatment matching</h4>
<p>Some participants’ best treatment matched what they were randomly assigned in the original trial. Other participants may have received a sub-optimal treatment (i.e., what the model identified as their second-best or worst treatment based on calculated probabilities). Thus, participants could be categorized as having received “best treatment” or “other treatment” in the original trial.</p>
<p>For example, the individual described above received varenicline in the original trial, but their model-predicted probability of abstinence was highest when substituting C-NRT for treatment. This participant’s best treatment did not match their trial treatment, so they were labeled as matched to “other treatment.”</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis-plan" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-plan">Analysis plan</h4>
<p>Our primary analysis evaluated the clinical benefit of our treatment selection model by comparing the observed outcomes (i.e., abstinence vs.&nbsp;smoking from the original trial) for people who were matched to their best treatment or to other treatment (between-subjects; 0.5 [“best treatment”] vs.&nbsp;-0.5 [“other treatment”]).</p>
<p>We examined this effect of treatment matching on abstinence at 4, 12, and 26 weeks post-quit. Calculating and interpreting interactions in logistic models is not straightforward because significance can differ based on the link function used and whether effects are determined in probabilities, odds, or log-odds units <span class="citation" data-cites="karaca-mandicInteractionTermsNonlinear2012 collinsOptimizationBehavioralBiobehavioral2018">(<a href="#ref-karaca-mandicInteractionTermsNonlinear2012" role="doc-biblioref">Karaca-Mandic, Norton, and Dowd 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-collinsOptimizationBehavioralBiobehavioral2018" role="doc-biblioref">Collins 2018</a>)</span>. Consequently, we conducted three, separate generalized logistic regression models where we regressed the outcome (abstinent vs.&nbsp;smoking) on treatment matching. We conducted these regressions using the lme4 package in R <span class="citation" data-cites="batesLme4LinearMixedEffects2015">(<a href="#ref-batesLme4LinearMixedEffects2015" role="doc-biblioref">Bates et al. 2015</a>)</span>.

<section id="fairness-benchmarks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fairness-benchmarks">Fairness benchmarks</h4>
<p>Treatment selection models that work for only a subset of people, if implemented, could widen existing mental healthcare disparities. Consequently, we conducted fairness analyses to determine whether there was equitable clinical benefit across demographic groups. We conducted analyses separately for three dichotomized demographic groups that display higher rates of cigarette smoking and/or encounter additional barriers to receiving treatment: 1) race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs.&nbsp;non-White); 2) income (above vs.&nbsp;below poverty line); and 3) sex at birth (male vs.&nbsp;female) <span class="citation" data-cites="jamalCurrentCigaretteSmoking2015a corneliusTobaccoProductUse2020 pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019 olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022 kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020">(<a href="#ref-jamalCurrentCigaretteSmoking2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Jamal et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-corneliusTobaccoProductUse2020" role="doc-biblioref">Cornelius 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pinedo 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022" role="doc-biblioref">Olfson et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kilaru et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For any times (4, 12, or 26 weeks) for which there was a significant benefit of treatment matching, we compared the effect across demographic groups. Given the issues with interpreting interactions in logistic regression models described above, we examined only simple effects of treatment matching for each pair of demographic groups (e.g., simple effect of treatment matching for non-Hispanic White and for non-White individuals) and did not interpret <em>p</em>-values.</p>

<section id="feature-engineering" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature engineering</h4>
<p>We followed standard practices for generic feature engineering steps (see Supplement). Treatment was one-hot-coded such that there were three features, one corresponding to each treatment (varenicline, C-NRT, nicotine patch). The three treatment features were allowed to interact with all other features to permit differential prediction. A sample feature engineering script (i.e., tidymodels recipe) containing all feature engineering steps is available on our OSF study page (<a href="https://osf.io/qad4n/">https://osf.io/qad4n/</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="model-configurations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configurations">Model configurations</h4>
<p>All model configurations used the statistical algorithm Elastic Net Logistic Regression (GLMNet) and differed across sensible values for the associated hyperparameters, alpha and lambda. This algorithm aligned with our application goals: GLMNet allows including interation terms explicitly (i.e., interactions between treatment and all other features), and it penalizes model complexity to reduce dimensionality and ultimately reduce the risk of overfitting. Model configurations differed by 1) whether feature sets included individual items within a self-report measure or total scale/sub-scale scores derived from items, and 2) whether ordered categorical data (e.g., Likert scale items) were ordinal scored or one-hot coded.</p>
</section>
<section id="prediction-outcome" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prediction-outcome">Prediction outcome</h4>
<p>The model prediction outcome was treatment success at 4 weeks post-quit (i.e., predicting if individuals were labeled “abstinent” or “smoking” at 4 weeks). We selected treatment success at 4 weeks in order to 1) predict an outcome that - in clinical practice - would allow individuals to pivot to a different medication earlier if their treatment was unsuccessful; and 2) evaluate the differential effects of treatment while participants were actively using the medications.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</section>
<section id="model-selection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection">Model selection</h4>
<p>We used nested <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation for model training, selection, and evaluation <span class="citation" data-cites="krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014">(<a href="#ref-krstajicCrossvalidationPitfallsWhen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Krstajic et al. 2014</a>)</span>. Nested cross-validation uses two nested loops for dividing and holding out folds: an outer loop, where held-out folds serve as <em>test sets</em> for model evaluation; and inner loops, where held-out folds serve as <em>validation sets</em> for model selection. We used 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation (i.e., <em>k</em> = 10) for the inner loops and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop.</p>
<p>Models were selected and evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC), which indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (abstinent) relative to a randomly selected negative case (smoking) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018 youngstromPrimerReceiverOperating2014">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-youngstromPrimerReceiverOperating2014" role="doc-biblioref">Youngstrom 2014</a>)</span>. Because it was important that our model retained interaction features, we required that model configurations retain an average of 50 or more treatment interaction features <span class="citation" data-cites="ngMachineLearningYearning2018">(<a href="#ref-ngMachineLearningYearning2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ng 2018</a>)</span>. Best model configurations were selected using median auROC among model configurations that retained a median of 50 treatment interaction features across the 10 <em>validation sets</em>. Final performance evaluation of those best model configurations used median auROC across the 30 <em>test sets</em>.</p>
<p>To get a single, final model configuration, we replicated our inner loop resampling (1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation) on the full dataset. The best model configuration was selected using median auROC across the 10 held-out folds (among model configurations that retained a median of 50 treatment interaction features). This best model configuration was used to make predictions for clinical benefit evaluation (above) and feature importance analyses (see Model Interpretation). A final model was fit on the full dataset using this best configuration to obtain parameter estimates for additional interpretation (see Model Interpretation).</p>

<!--KW: John had me add a little more information that we had moved to supplement for EMA paper when describing the Bayesian model. I updated your last paragraph to include this below. However, depending on word constraints you might need to move some of the info to supplement? Also, for the two new citations introduced you already have them in the paper_match zotero library!

We used a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) for test set auROC. Following recommendations from the rstanarm team and others [@rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2020; @gabryPriorDistributionsRstanarm2023], we used the rstanarm default autoscaled, weakly informative, data-dependent priors that take into account the order of magnitude of the variables to provide some regularization to stabilize computation and avoid over-fitting.^[Priors were set as follows: residual standard deviation ~ normal(location=0, scale=exp(2)), intercept (after centering predictors) ~ normal(location=2.3, scale=1.3), the two coefficients for window width contrasts ~ normal (location=0, scale=2.69), and covariance ~ decov(regularization=1, concentration=1, shape=1, scale=1).] We set two random intercepts to account for our resampling method: one for the repeat, and another for the fold nested within repeat. The median posterior probability for auROC represents our best estimate for the magnitude of the auROC parameter for each model. If the credible intervals do not contain .5 (chance performance), this suggests our model is capturing signal in the data.

<p>We also computed Shapley Values <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg and Lee 2017</a>)</span> to provide a consistent, objective explanation of feature importance. Shapley values were calculated for each held-out participant using a model fit with the other 1085 participants and the final, best selected model configuration.</p>
<p>We used the DALEX and DALEXtra packages <span class="citation" data-cites="biecekDALEXExplainersComplex2018">(<a href="#ref-biecekDALEXExplainersComplex2018" role="doc-biblioref">Biecek 2018</a>)</span> in R, which provide local Shapley values (i.e., for each observation) in log-odds units for binary classification models. To index global feature importance, we averaged the absolute value of the local Shapley values of each feature across observations. Shapley values are additive, which allowed us to create two feature categories, Main Effects and Interactions. We calculated global importance of each feature category by averaging the absolute value of the Shapley values of all features in the category across observations. These global importance scores allowed us to contextualize relative feature importance for each feature and feature category.</p>

<p>We conducted follow-up fairness analyses for the significant effect of treatment matching at 4 weeks. <em>Figure X</em> shows the mean abstinence rate for individuals matched to their best treatment and individuals matched to other treatment separately by sex (Panel A), race/ethnicity (Panel B), and income (Panel C). The treatment matching effect size was similar for male (OR = 1.395) and female (OR = 1.372) participants, and abstinence rates were similar across groups. Non-White participants had a descriptively greater benefit of treatment matching (OR = 2.164) than non-Hispanic White participants (OR = 1.208). However, abstinence rates overall were lower for non-White participants. The treatment matching benefit was similar for individuals whose income was above (OR = ) and below (OR = ) the national poverty line, but abstinence rates were lower overall for individuals below the poverty line.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>We used the 30 test set auROCs to estimate the posterior probability distribution for the auROC of these models. The median auROC from the posterior distribution was 0.693. This value represents our best estimate for the magnitude of the auROC parameter. The 95% Bayesian CI for the auROC was relatively narrow [0.674 - 0.711] and did not contain 0.5 (chance performance), providing strong evidence that this model has predictive signal. <a href="#fig-combined" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, Panel B displays the posterior probability distribution for the auROC.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig-combined" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, Panel C, we display our model’s calibration. Predicted probabilities are binned (bin width = 10%) and plotted against the observed probability of abstinence for observations in that bin. If probabilities were perfectly calibrated, all bin means would fall on the dotted line (e.g., bin from 0 - 10 with an observed mean probability of 0.05, bin from 10 - 20 with an observed mean probability of 0.15). Probabilities are well calibrated and ordinal in their relationship with the true probability of abstinence.</p>

<p>Our final model fit with the full dataset retained 155 features overall including 74 treatment interactions (see Supplemental Table X for retained feature list). To perform treatment selection, only interactive features need to be assessed, as features that increase or decrease probabilities equally across treatments do not help to make different predictions across candidate medications. Implementing this model for treatment selection requires assessing only 52 unique items (e.g., multiple one hot features are from a single item, the same feature interacts with more than one treatment).</p>
<p>Global feature importance (mean |Shapley value|) from our model appears in <a href="#fig-shap-global" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>.

<p>In this project, we produced a treatment selection model that can offer immediate benefit to individuals looking to quit smoking using several first-line medications. Individuals who received their model-predicted best treatment in the original trial had a mean abstinence rate that was 7.4% higher than individuals who did not (38.9% vs.&nbsp;31.5%) at 4 weeks. Although this absolute difference may seem somewhat small, this corresponds to a 23.5% <em>relative</em> improvement - simply by allocating treatments to the right person.<!-- good!  --></p>
<p>We feel confident in this effect for several reasons. First, we made predictions for each individual to identify their best treatment while they were held-out from model fitting to match how this model will be used in clinical practice (i.e., to make predictions and select a treatment for new patients). Second, our model is capturing predictive signal, as supported by the Bayesian CI around our model’s auROC, adding to our trust in the model’s prediction outputs. Third, these predictions were well-calibrated such that we can trust their ordinal ranking. This is critical because our treatment selection process relies on the relative <em>order</em> (i.e., rank) of predicted probabilities for each person rather than the values themselves.</p>
<p>We can achieve this benefit using an accessible, low-burden assessment. Implementing this treatment selection model would require assessing approximately 50 multiple choice and yes/no questions, which survey research suggests would take 11-12 minutes to complete <span class="citation" data-cites="lenznerCognitiveBurdenSurvey2010">(<a href="#ref-lenznerCognitiveBurdenSurvey2010" role="doc-biblioref">Lenzner, Kaczmirek, and Lenzner 2010</a>)</span>. Additionally, because all items are self-report questions, this assessment can be completed remotely (e.g., administered online) and can be made available to people without access to in-person medical care. This remote capacity is particularly valuable because two treatments in the model (C-NRT, nicotine patch) are widely available over-the-counter, offering scalable implementation when healthcare access is limited.</p>
<!--  will need to synch this next paragraph with fairness for clinical benefit -->
<p>This focus on accessibility is especially important given disparities in mental healthcare.

<p>We further addressed this goal with our fairness analyses. We found that our treatment selection model may be well-positioned to improve treatment equity: Our model offered comparable benefit for female (vs.&nbsp;male) and lower income (vs.&nbsp;higher income) individuals, and it offered greater relative benefit to non-White individuals (vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White individuals). If our goal is to reduce and ultimately close the treatment gap between privileged individuals and individuals often disadvantaged in research efforts and mental healthcare, then we need tools such as this model that offer <em>additional</em> benefit to those disadvantaged demographic groups.</p>
<section id="improving-long-term-benefit-of-treatment-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="improving-long-term-benefit-of-treatment-selection">Improving long-term benefit of treatment selection</h3>
<p>Alongside these exciting findings, the clinical benefit that our treatment selection model offers is short-lived. There is no longer statistically significant benefit of treatment matching at 12 weeks, though there is a numeric difference (31.2% abstinence vs.&nbsp;27.8% abstinence, corresponding to a 12.2% relative improvement), and there is no statistical or numeric difference at all by 6 months.</p>
<p>Initial treatment success is critical, especially for cigarette smoking where even reducing smoking or quitting for a short period of time can improve health outcomes and life expectancy <span class="citation" data-cites="jhaprabhat21stCenturyHazardsSmoking2013">(<a href="#ref-jhaprabhat21stCenturyHazardsSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Jha Prabhat et al. 2013</a>)</span>. Additionally, smoking early in a quit attempt can have strong negative consequences: decreased self-efficacy, reduced treatment adherence, and premature treatment cessation <span class="citation" data-cites="schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013">(<a href="#ref-schlamInterventionsTobaccoSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Schlam and Baker 2013</a>)</span>. Selecting a treatment that increases treatment success in early recovery (i.e., at 4 weeks) is therefore necessary - though not sufficient - for long-term success. Nevertheless, we were of course hopeful that treatment matching benefits would endure. However, it is perhaps unsurprising that they do not. There may be several possibilities for the lack of benefit at later assessment points.</p>
<p>First, it is possible that we could have improved treatment selection by improving the underlying model’s predictive performance. Our best estimate of median auROC in held-out data (from the posterior probability distribution) was 0.69, indicating that our model correctly assigns a higher probability to a positive (abstinent) case than a negative (smoking) case 69% of the time. An auROC of 0.7 to 0.8 is considered “acceptable” <span class="citation" data-cites="mandrekarReceiverOperatingCharacteristic2010">(<a href="#ref-mandrekarReceiverOperatingCharacteristic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Mandrekar 2010</a>)</span>. Our model was right on the cusp of this range, but there is room for improvement.</p>
<p>Capturing some signal with our model was necessary to yield credible predictions and establish the relevance of features, and so our model’s modest predictive performance may have impacted our ability to select treatments. However, overall prediction of treatment success was not our primary goal and is insufficient for treatment selection. A model that predicted treatment success perfectly (i.e., auROC of 1.0) but included no interactions would be useless for treatment selection. Indeed, this fact motivated our use of a satisficing metric for a minimum number of interaction terms retained in our models, even though it is possible that we sacrificed some level of predictive power by imposing that additional criterion.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that we were missing important model inputs. We began by discussing the need for many features and multiple treatments in treatment selection models. Although our model had a rich set of features, we may have been missing features that might have improved underlying model performance or are critical for selecting among these smoking cessation treatments. Our data come from a large comparative effectiveness trial conducted by a nationally recognized center and designed by foremost experts in the field <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016">(<a href="#ref-bakerEffectsNicotinePatch2016" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al. 2016</a>)</span>. The baseline assessment was quite comprehensive and was based on domain expertise and decades of research. Thus, it seems unlikely that we could be missing enough important self-report features to bridge the gap in our benefit of treatment selection.</p>
<p>One category of features we did not include was biological markers or genetic features, which have generated excitement for their potential for treatment selection <span class="citation" data-cites="chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018">(<a href="#ref-chenPathwaysPrecisionMedicine2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chen, Horton, and Bierut 2018</a>)</span>. However, extant literature has primarily used single candidate genes or biomarkers, has also not found long-term benefits, and has not translated well into real-world settings <span class="citation" data-cites="chenGeneticVariantCHRNA52020 shahabDoesNicotineMetabolite2019 schnollNicotineMetabolicRate2009 glatardAssociationNicotineMetabolism2017 chenowethNicotineMetaboliteRatio2016 lermanUseNicotineMetabolite2015 siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020">(<a href="#ref-chenGeneticVariantCHRNA52020" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-shahabDoesNicotineMetabolite2019" role="doc-biblioref">Shahab et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-schnollNicotineMetabolicRate2009" role="doc-biblioref">Schnoll et al. 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-glatardAssociationNicotineMetabolism2017" role="doc-biblioref">Glatard et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-chenowethNicotineMetaboliteRatio2016" role="doc-biblioref">Chenoweth et al. 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-lermanUseNicotineMetabolite2015" role="doc-biblioref">Lerman et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-siegelUseNicotineMetabolite2020" role="doc-biblioref">Siegel et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Additionally, the potential improvement that could come from including biological or genetic features carries an associated cost to implementation given the relative inaccessibility of genetic and biological testing <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We may also have been missing model inputs on the treatment side. For example, bupropion is another first-line smoking cessation medication <span class="citation" data-cites="cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013">(<a href="#ref-cahillPharmacologicalInterventionsSmoking2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cahill et al. 2013</a>)</span>. It may be that some features in this model do not differentiate among C-NRT, nicotine patch, or varenicline but would differentiate between one of these treatments and bupropion. There may be individuals in our sample for whom none of our included treatments were optimal, but bupropion might have been. If true, including bupropion could have improved model performance and increased clinical benefit.</p>
<p>A third, notable possibility is that our model did not capture dynamic changes over time. It may be that the same features predict treatment success across time. However, because these characteristics can change dynamically <em>within an individual</em>, what was the right treatment based on pre-quit characteristics is no longer the right treatment by 12 weeks, 6 months, or beyond. Many of the features used for prediction in this model were baseline measurements of <em>current</em> states - withdrawal, dependence, confidence/motivation to quit, time around other smokers, distress tolerance, depression symptoms, among others. Even features that feel more “static” like employment or marital status can be subject to change.</p>
<p>Dynamic change is the rule rather than the exception when it comes to chronic diseases like substance use disorders. Tobacco and other substance use disorders are dynamic and relapsing; both risk for use and the factors driving that risk fluctuate over time <span class="citation" data-cites="brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007">(<a href="#ref-brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007" role="doc-biblioref">Brandon, Vidrine, and Litvin 2007</a>)</span>. This change over time has been identified as a key barrier to overcome for precision mental health goals in addiction <span class="citation" data-cites="oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017">(<a href="#ref-oliverPrecisionMedicineAddiction2017" role="doc-biblioref">Oliver and McClernon 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Accounting for dynamic changes will require ongoing assessment of key features that predict treatment success. Such monitoring is now feasible given developments in personal sensing (i.e., in situ data collection via sensors embedded in individuals’ daily lives) <span class="citation" data-cites="epsteinPredictionStressDrug2020 soysterPooledPersonspecificMachine2022 chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014 baeMobilePhoneSensors2018 wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-epsteinPredictionStressDrug2020" role="doc-biblioref">Epstein et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-soysterPooledPersonspecificMachine2022" role="doc-biblioref">Soyster, Ashlock, and Fisher 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014" role="doc-biblioref">Chih et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-baeMobilePhoneSensors2018" role="doc-biblioref">Bae et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2024</a>)</span> and is acceptable to individuals with substance use disorders <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Sensing via ecological momentary assessment is well-positioned to capture the self-report items used as features in this treatment selection model. Although frequently answering a 50-item survey is likely not feasible, it may be that more proximal features have greater predictive power, thus requiring fewer features for successful treatment selection. Indeed, in previous work in our laboratory, we have been able to predict hour-by-hour probabilities of alcohol lapses quite accurately (auROCs &gt; 0.9) using features derived from only 10 self-report items that were measured much closer to the outcome <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Using dynamic monitoring, we can select and adapt treatments and supports over time. There are certainly opportunities to adapt medications – for example, titrating doses or identifying moments when someone could benefit most from a lozenge. In general, medications are more static treatments that are less well-suited to dynamic changes, but they do not need to be used on their own. We observed that matching people to the right medication improves treatment success at 4 weeks. Medications could help create early treatment success that positions people to engage with additional supports that might be able to adapt more dynamically. Alternative treatments and supports via web-based interventions and mobile health apps may offer platforms for sustainable, scalable, ongoing support. With ongoing monitoring, we could even recommend specific modules and individual tools that map onto currently important features affecting treatment success. This mapping between risk factors and supports is likely to be quite complex and will require considerable future research. But if we hope to advance precision mental health for smoking, addiction, and even mental health broadly, we must consider the dynamic nature of risk and recovery inherent in these conditions.</p>

<section id="interpreting-our-treatment-selection-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpreting-our-treatment-selection-model">Interpreting our treatment selection model</h3>
<p>Several recent reviews have noted that the low interpretability of “black box” machine learning models may impede their utility for clinical and public health goals <span class="citation" data-cites="maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021 mooneyBigDataPublic2018 cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018">(<a href="#ref-maceachernMachineLearningPrecision2021" role="doc-biblioref">MacEachern and Forkert 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-mooneyBigDataPublic2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mooney and Pejaver 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-cohenTreatmentSelectionDepression2018" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen and DeRubeis 2018</a>)</span>. Consequently, we aimed to make our model as interpretable as possible. We identified features that predict differential treatment success (i.e., features that interact with treatment to help us select among treatments). Our best selected model configuration retained 74 interaction terms that spanned 52 unique items. Each feature’s associated global Shapley value, which indicates overall magnitude of feature importance, was relatively small. This finding supports what has long been suspected in precision mental health: There is no one feature that explains sufficient variance to make differential predictions by treatment on its own. Rather, each feature offers only a small contribution, but many features together can guide treatment selection.</p>
<p>We also identified features that predict treatment success overall (i.e., “main effects”). These features contribute to the smoking cessation literature and support the conclusion from a recent review that predictors of treatment success span many categories <span class="citation" data-cites="bickelPredictorsSmokingCessation2023">(<a href="#ref-bickelPredictorsSmokingCessation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Bickel et al. 2023</a>)</span>. We found similar breadth in important features in this model: economic (e.g., income), environmental (e.g., living with another smoker), sociodemographic (e.g., marital status), psychological (e.g., depression diagnosis), physical health (e.g., pain interfering with daily activities), and smoking use/history (e.g., longest previous quit attempt) characteristics all contributed to predicting treatment success.</p>
<p>These “main effect” features may yet help to advance precision mental health goals. These features may represent mechanisms underlying smoking cessation success and thus offer targeted areas for future treatment development. They also may be used to tailor existing treatments to increase success across individuals. Main effect features in our model may also interact with other treatments not included in this study such as bupropion.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-demographic-features" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-demographic-features">The role of demographic features</h4>
<p>Several demographic features emerged as important interactive features for treatment selection: race, gender, income, and marital status. Ethnicity did not emerge as an important interactive feature, and race-based interactive features were specifically related to identifying as a Black or White individual. However, the limited representation of Hispanic, Latino/a, Asian, Multiracial, and Native American/Alaska Native individuals in this sample warrants caution in drawing conclusions about the utility of ethnicity- and other race-based features for treatment selection.</p>
<p>In some contexts, it would be problematic to use features that tap into constructs delineating marginalized identities such as race or socioeconomic status. For example, making decisions about who gets insurance (or doesn’t) and who gets released earlier from incarceration (or doesn’t) based on race is discriminatory (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="farayolaEthicsTrustworthinessAI2023">(<a href="#ref-farayolaEthicsTrustworthinessAI2023" role="doc-biblioref">Farayola et al. 2023</a>)</span>). However, in the precision mental health landscape, we are not deciding <em>who</em> gets treatment. Rather, we are deciding <em>which</em> treatment to give a specific patient. We can take advantage of experiential or symptomatological differences as a result of characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, income, or comorbid health conditions to improve treatment outcomes across vulnerable subpopulations.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-risk-of-transparency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-risk-of-transparency">The risk of transparency</h4>
<p>When patients and clinicians can easily see non-intuitive features, they may be dissuaded from using or trusting this treatment selection model. They may have similar concerns if they see demographic features are being used to make treatment decisions. With high-dimensional data and subsequent complex modeling, even the direction of an effect can be non-intuitive because a parameter estimate indicates a feature’s effect while accounting for all other features in the model. Regardless of the reason, the reality is that seeing non-intuitive questions on a treatment selection assessment or unpacking precisely how a model is making its decision may make patients or clinicians doubt the trustworthiness of the model. Careful consideration will be required before implementation to assess acceptability of treatment selection models for all stakeholders.</p>
</section>

<section id="future-directions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions">Future directions</h3>
<p>We made a concerted effort in this project to evaluate how our treatment selection model would perform for new patients using cross-validation procedures. Regardless, the ultimate test of this model’s clinical benefit will be in a prospective trial. This trial will offer two tests. First, it will assess whether using this model is feasible and acceptable to patients and clinicians in clinical practice. Second, we can evaluate the benefit of our treatment selection model in an entirely new sample. Individuals who receive their model-predicted best treatment could be compared to any one of several possible comparison groups. Individuals in the comparison group could receive a random treatment assignment (mimicking clinical trials). Alternatively, they could receive clinician-assigned treatment to mirror traditional treatment selection (and best clinical practice). Another option is that we could compare to a simpler model. For example, there is evidence that treatment adherence is higher when people choose their preferred treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="cropseyPilotTrialVivo2017">(<a href="#ref-cropseyPilotTrialVivo2017" role="doc-biblioref">K. L. Cropsey et al. 2017</a>)</span>. Thus, treatments in the comparison group could be assigned based on patient preference. Each comparison offers different advantages and disadvantages that should be considered thoughtfully when designing a prospective trial.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, this study has potential for immediate benefit to individuals looking to quit smoking. Our treatment selection model can improve the probability of abstinence during early recovery by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful margin. Moreover, we aimed to address health inequities by using a relatively low-burden assessment that uses widely accessible features and by ensuring our model provides equal if not relatively greater clinical benefit for individuals from several minoritized demographic groups. This treatment selection model may serve as an initial tool embedded in a continuing care landscape where treatments are adapted dynamically over time. The ultimate test of our model will be in a prospective trial that assesses its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in clinical practice. We are optimistic about the promise our model holds to improve the public health burden of cigarette smoking.</p>
