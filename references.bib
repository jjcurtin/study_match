  abstract = {There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying objective and accurate markers of cocaine dependence (CD) can innovate its prevention and treatment. Existing evidence suggests that CD is characterized by a wide range of cognitive deficits, most notably by increased impulsivity. Impulsivity is multidimensional and it is unclear which of its various dimensions would have the highest predictive utility for CD. The machine-learning approach is highly promising for discovering predictive markers of disease. Here, we used machine learning to identify multivariate predictive patterns of impulsivity phenotypes that can accurately classify individuals with CD. METHODS: Current cocaine-dependent users (N\,=\,31) and healthy controls (N\,=\,23) completed the self-report Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 and five neurocognitive tasks indexing different dimensions of impulsivity: (1) Immediate Memory Task (IMT), (2) Stop-Signal Task, (3) Delay-Discounting Task (DDT), (4) Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and (5) Probabilistic Reversal-Learning task. We applied a machine-learning algorithm to all impulsivity measures. RESULTS: Machine learning accurately classified individuals with CD and predictions were generalizable to new samples (area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.912 in the test set). CD membership was predicted by higher scores on motor and non-planning trait impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and discriminability on the IMT, higher delay discounting on the DDT, and poor decision making on the IGT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that multivariate behavioral impulsivity phenotypes can predict CD with high degree of accuracy, which can potentially be used to assess individuals' vulnerability to CD in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({$>$}4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week quit rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three-group randomized intention-to-treat clinical trial occurring from May 2012 to November 2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, communities; 65.5\% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) refused participation prior to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch only (n\,=\,241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; n\,=\,424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch\,+\,nicotine lozenge; n\,=\,421). Six counseling sessions were offered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52. RESULTS: Among 1086 smokers randomized (52\% women; 67\% white; mean age, 48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84\%) provided 12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8\% [55/241]; varenicline, 23.6\% [100/424]; and C-NRT, 26.8\% [113/421]) or at 52 weeks (nicotine patch, 20.8\% [50/241]; varenicline, 19.1\% [81/424]; and C-NRT, 20.2\% [85/421]). At 26 weeks, the risk differences for abstinence were, for patch vs varenicline, -0.76\% (95\% CI, -7.4\% to 5.9\%); for patch vs C-NRT, -4.0\% (95\% CI, -10.8\% to 2.8\%); and for varenicline vs C-NRT, -3.3\% (95\% CI, -9.1\% to 2.6\%). All medications were well tolerated, but varenicline produced more frequent adverse events than did the nicotine patch for vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and indigestion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or C-NRT produced no significant differences in biochemically confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise questions about the relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01553084.},

This review evaluates the reach and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for smoking. Historically, the reach of smoking treatment has been low, and therefore its impact has been limited, but new reach strategies such as digital interventions and health care system changes offer great promise. Pharmacotherapy tends to be more effective than psychosocial intervention when used clinically, and newer pharmacotherapy strategies hold great promise of further enhancing effectiveness. However, new approaches are needed to advance psychosocial interventions; progress has stagnated because research and dissemination efforts have focused too narrowly on skill training despite evidence that its core content may be inconsequential and the fact that its mechanisms are either unknown or inconsistent with supporting theory. Identifying effective psychosocial content and its mechanisms of action could greatly enhance the effectiveness of counseling, digital, and web interventions.},

  abstract = {Neurocognitive dysfunctions are frequently identified in the addictions. These dysfunctions may indicate either diffuse dysfunction or may represent separate facets that have differential importance to the addiction phenotype. In a sample (n = 260) of alcohol and/or stimulant users and controls we measured responses across 7 diverse neurocognitive measures. These measures were Continuous Performance, Delay Discounting, Iowa Gambling, Stroop, Tower, Wisconsin Card Sorting, and Letter Number Sequencing. Comparisons were then made between the drug-dependent groups and controls using analysis of variance and also using a machine learning approach to classify participants based on task performance as substance-dependent or controls in 1 tree and as alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls in a second tree. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups on the Delay Discounting (p {$<$} .001), Iowa Gambling (p {$<$} .001), Letter Number Sequencing (p {$<$} .001), and Wisconsin Card Sorting (p {$<$} .05) tasks. The first classification tree correctly classified between substance-dependent or controls for 88.3\% of participants and classified between alcohol and/or stimulant users or controls for 63.9\% of participants. Delay discounting was the first split in both trees and in the substance-dependent and control tree. The analysis of variance results largely replicate previous findings. The machine learning classification tree analysis provides evidence to support the hypothesis that different measures of neurocognitive dysfunction represent different processes. Among them, delay discounting was the most robust in categorizing drug dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Predictive modeling is invaded by elastic, yet complex methods such as neural networks or ensembles (model stacking, boosting or bagging). Such methods are usually described by a large number of parameters or hyper parameters - a price that one needs to pay for elasticity. The very number of parameters makes models hard to understand. This paper describes a consistent collection of explainers for predictive models, a.k.a. black boxes. Each explainer is a technique for exploration of a black box model. Presented approaches are model-agnostic, what means that they extract useful information from any predictive method irrespective of its internal structure. Each explainer is linked with a specific aspect of a model. Some are useful in decomposing predictions, some serve better in understanding performance, while others are useful in understanding importance and conditional responses of a particular variable. Every explainer presented here works for a single model or for a collection of models. In the latter case, models can be compared against each other. Such comparison helps to find strengths and weaknesses of different models and gives additional tools for model validation. Presented explainers are implemented in the DALEX package for R. They are based on a uniform standardized grammar of model exploration which may be easily extended.},

Summary statistics derived from large discovery GWASs can be used to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in independent, target data sets to examine correlates of polygenic disorder liability (e.g., does genetic liability to schizophrenia predict cognition?). The intuitive appeal and generalizability of PRS have led to their widespread use and new insights into mechanisms of polygenic liability. However, when currently applied across traits they account for small amounts of variance ({$<$}3\%), are relatively uninformative for clinical treatment, and, in isolation, provide no insight into molecular mechanisms. Larger GWASs are needed to increase the precision of PRS, and novel approaches integrating various data sources (e.g., multitrait analysis of GWASs) may improve the utility of current PRS.},

We say that a test has low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular random partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets.

Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.},

  abstract = {Background         , When people stop smoking they experience cravings to smoke and unpleasant mood changes. Nicotine receptor partial agonists aim to reduce these withdrawal symptoms and the pleasure people usually experience when they smoke. The most widely-available treatment in this drug type is varenicline, which is available world-wide as an aid for quitting smoking. Cytisine is a similar medication, but is only available in Central and Eastern European countries and through internet sales.,            Study characteristics         , We searched for randomised controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisine or dianicline. We found 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. We also found four trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. We include one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a quitting aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the start of treatment. We preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids.We conducted full searches up to May 2015, although we have also included several key trials published after that date.,            Key findings         , From the information we found (27 trials, 12,625 people), varenicline at standard dose more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo. Low-dose varenicline (four trials, 1266 people) roughly doubled the chances of quitting, and reduced the number and severity of side effects. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion (five trials, 5877 people) or with NRT (eight trials, 6264 people). Based on the evidence so far, we can calculate that varenicline delivers one extra successful quitter for every 11 people treated, compared with smokers trying to quit without varenicline., The most common side effect of varenicline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time. People taking varenicline appear to have about a 25\% increased chance of a serious adverse event, although these include many which are unrelated to the treatment. We also note that more people were lost from the control groups than from the varenicline groups by the end of the trials, which may mean that the count of events in the control groups is lower than it should be. After varenicline became available to use, there were concerns that it could be linked with an increase in depressed mood, agitation, or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers. However, the latest evidence does not support a link between varenicline and these disorders, although people with past or current psychiatric illness may be at slightly higher risk. There have also been concerns that varenicline may slightly increase heart and circulatory problems in people already at increased risk of these illnesses. The evidence is currently unclear whether or not they are caused or made worse by varenicline, but we should have clearer answers to these questions when a further study is published later this year.,            Quality of the evidence         , The varenicline studies were generally of high quality, providing evidence that we consider to be reliable and robust. We rate the quality of the evidence comparing varenicline with NRT as moderate quality (we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), since in some of them the participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. non-blinded open-label trials). We judge the evidence from the cytsine trials to be of low quality (we have limited confidence in the evidence), as there are only two trials, with relatively low numbers included.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? METHODS: The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95\% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95\% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95\% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95\% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95\% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95\% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95\% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95\% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95\% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95\% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95\% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95\% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95\% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95\% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95\% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95\% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95\% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.},

  abstract = {Objectives The number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit successfully is a commonly reported figure among smoking cessation programmes, but previous estimates have been based on lifetime recall in cross-sectional samples of successful quitters only. The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations.},

  abstract = {It is unclear if genetic variants affect smoking cessation treatment response. This study tested whether variants in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit (CHRNA5) predict response to smoking cessation medication by directly comparing the two most effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. In this genotype-stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (May 2015--August 2019 in St Louis, Missouri), smokers were randomized by genotype in blocks of six (1:1:1 ratio) to three conditions: 12 weeks of placebo (n = 273), combination nicotine patch and lozenge (combination nicotine replacement therapy, cNRT, n = 275), or varenicline (n = 274). All participants received counseling and were followed for 12 months. The primary end point was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT, week 12). Trial registration and eligibility criteria are on clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT02351167). We conducted the genetic analyses separately for 516 European ancestry (EA) smokers and 306 non-EA smokers (including 270 African American smokers). In African American smokers, there was a genotype-by-treatment interaction for EOT abstinence ({$\chi$}2 = 10.7, degrees of freedom = 2. P = 0.0049): specifically, cNRT was more effective in smokers with rs16969968 GG genotype than was placebo, while varenicline was more effective in smokers of GA/AA genotypes. In EA ancestry smokers, there was no significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. In the whole sample, although both were effective at EOT, only varenicline, and not cNRT, was significantly effective relative to placebo at 6-month follow-up. Importantly, this study suggests that genetic information can further enhance smoking cessation treatment effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The decrease in smoking rates in North America has plateaued, underscoring the need for new approaches to treat nicotine dependence. Inter-individual differences in smoking behavior result, in part, from variation in the rate of CYP2A6 -mediated nicotine metabolism. A phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity is the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), the ratio of 3{$\prime$}hydroxycotinine/cotinine. The NMR is associated with smoking cessation. However, the NMR is also associated with genetic (eg, CYP2A6 genotype) and other (eg, sex and ethnicity) factors. Here we aimed to determine if previously identified non- CYP2A6 sources of variation in the NMR mitigated the association between the NMR and short-term abstinence.  The NMR was determined from blood samples collected at intake from daily smokers aged 18--65. Biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide level {$\leq$} 8 ppm) was measured at 1 week following the target quit date in participants from a smoking cessation clinical trial (NCT01314001). Analyses were restricted to N = 462 blacks and N = 693 whites in the intent-to-treat sample.  Lower NMR (\&lt;0.31) was associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence ( OR = 1.43; 95\% CI = 1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NMR was associated with 1-week smoking abstinence; NMR may be a useful addition to medication screening approaches evaluating treatments for nicotine dependence.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoking is highly addictive and modern genetic research has identified robust genetic influences on nicotine dependence. An important step in translating these genetic findings to clinical practice is identifying the genetic factors affecting smoking cessation in order to enhance current smoking cessation treatments. We reviewed the significant genetic variants that predict nicotine dependence, smoking cessation, and response to cessation pharmacotherapy. These data suggest that genetic risks can predict smoking cessation outcomes and moderate the effect of pharmacological treatments. Some pharmacogenetic findings have been replicated in meta-analyses or in multiple smoking cessation trials. The variation in efficacy between smokers with different genetic markers supports the notion that personalized smoking cessation intervention based upon genotype could maximize the efficiency of such treatment while minimizing side effects, thus influencing the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm. In summary, as precision medicine is revolutionizing healthcare, smoking cessation may be one of the first areas where genetic variants may identify individuals at increased risk. Current evidence strongly suggests that genetic variants predict cessation failure and that cessation pharmacotherapy effectiveness is modulated by biomarkers such as nicotinic cholinergic receptor {$\alpha$}5 subunit (CHRNA5) genotypes or nicotine metabolism ratio (NMR). These findings strengthen the case for the development and rigorous testing of treatments that target patients with different biological risk profiles.},

Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients' recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation. The sensitivity/specificity table assists the tradeoff decisions necessary to apply the model in practice. This study moves us closer to the goal of providing lapse prediction so that patients might receive more targeted and timely support.},

For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,{$\lambda$}) penalty with {$\lambda\rightarrow$}0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org)., Editors' note: In order to encourage dissemination of the TRIPOD Statement, this article is freely accessible on the Annals of Internal Medicine Web site (www.annals.org) and will be also published in BJOG, British Journal of Cancer, British Journal of Surgery, BMC Medicine, British Medical Journal, Circulation, Diabetic Medicine, European Journal of Clinical Investigation, European Urology, and Journal of Clinical Epidemiology.

Evidence-based tobacco use treatment improves the likelihood of quitting, but more than two-thirds of individuals relapse when provided even the most robust treatments. Identifying for whom treatment is effective will improve the success of our treatments and perhaps identify strategies for improving current approaches.Two cohorts (training: N = 90, validation: N = 71) of cigarette smokers enrolled in group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify baseline predictors of outcome, as defined by breath carbon monoxide and urine cotinine. Significant measures were entered as candidate variables to predict quit status. The resulting decision trees were used to predict cessation outcomes in a validation cohort.In the training cohort, the decision trees significantly improved on chance classification of smoking status following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The first split of all decision trees, which was delay discounting, significantly improved on chance classification rates in both the training and validation cohort. Delay discounting emerged as the single best predictor of group CBT treatment response with an average baseline discount rate of ln(k) = -7.1, correctly predicting smoking status of 80\% of participants at posttreatment and 81\% of participants at follow-up.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation though future work is needed to identify individuals that are likely to be successful in treatments beyond group CBT.This study provides a first step toward personalized care for smoking cessation. Using a novel machine-learning approach, baseline measures of clinical and executive functioning are used to predict smoking cessation outcomes following group CBT. A decision point is recommended for the single best predictor of treatment outcomes, delay discounting, to inform future research or clinical practice in an effort to better allocate patients to treatments that are likely to work.},

Method: The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS). Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon \& Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

Educational approaches have not been shown to promote adherence or cessation, though medication sampling has boosted both use and cessation. The objective of the present study was to determine whether In vivo nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling approach increases NRT adherence among criminal justice smokers during a subsequent quit attempt. Methods We conducted a pilot study with 43 community corrections smokers randomized to a 4-session (one 30-min session per week) precessation intervention of either In vivo NRT sampling (Session 1: patch; Session 2: gum; Session 3: combination NRT (cNRT); Session 4: review) vs. 4 time-matched sessions of standard smoking cessation with cNRT started after Session 1. Both groups received an additional 8weeks of cNRT following the four intervention sessions. Results During the in vivo administration of NRT, total withdrawal and craving severity significantly decreased from pre- to post-session compared to Control participants. In vivo participants evinced greater patch use at Session 4 and greater gum use through Week 8 relative to Controls. Discussion In vivo NRT sampling may increase NRT adherence relative to standard counseling sessions among criminal justice smokers. A larger trial of this novel intervention appears to be warranted.},

A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems. It behooves the field to continue to learn and develop the most powerful methods that can produce generalizable knowledge that will advance the aims of precision mental health.},

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate and test a new method for integrating predictive information to aid in treatment selection, using data from a randomized treatment comparison. METHOD: Data from a trial of antidepressant medications (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}104) versus cognitive behavioral therapy (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}50) for Major Depressive Disorder were used to produce predictions of post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) in each of the two treatments for each of the 154 patients. The patient's own data were not used in the models that yielded these predictions. Five pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response (marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression models, permitting the calculation of each patient's Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units. RESULTS: For 60\% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI{$\geq$}3) was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their "Optimal" treatment versus those assigned to their "Non-optimal" treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.58, 95\% CI .17-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: This approach to treatment selection, implemented in the context of two equally effective treatments, yielded effects that, if obtained prospectively, would rival those routinely observed in comparisons of active versus control treatments.},

AI provides unrivalled high computing power, speed, and accuracy; all harnessed to strengthen the efficiency in predicting convicted individuals who may be on the verge of recommitting a crime. The application of AI models for predicting recidivism has brought positive effects by minimizing the possible re-occurrence of crime. However, the question remains of whether criminal justice system stakeholders can trust AI systems regarding fairness, transparency, privacy and data protection, consistency, societal well-being, and accountability when predicting convicted individuals' possible risk of recidivism. These are all requirements for a trustworthy AI. This paper conducted a systematic literature review examining trust and the different requirements for trustworthy AI applied to predicting the risks of recidivism. Based on this review, we identified current challenges and future directions regarding applying AI models to predict the risk of recidivism.

  abstract = {The widely acknowledged homogeneity assumption limits progress in refining clinical diagnosis, understanding mechanisms, and developing new treatments for mental health disorders. This homogeneity assumption drives both a comorbidity and a heterogeneity problem, where two different approaches tackle the problems. One, a unifying approach, tackles the comorbidity problem by assuming that a single general psychopathology factor underlies multiple disorders. Another, a multifactorial approach, tackles the heterogeneity problem by assuming that disorders comprise multiple subtypes driven by multiple discrete factors. We show how each of these approaches can make useful contributions to mental health--related research and clinical practice. For example, the unifying approach can develop a rapid assessment tool that may be clinically valuable for triaging cases. The multifactorial approach can reveal subtypes that are differentially responsive to treatments and highlight distinct mechanisms leading to similar phenotypes. Because both approaches tackle different problems, both have different limitations. We describe the statistical frameworks that incorporate and adjudicate between both approaches (e.g., the bifactor model, normative modeling, and the functional random forest). Such frameworks can identify whether sets of disorders are more affected by heterogeneity or comorbidity. Therefore, future studies that incorporate such frameworks can provide further insight into the nature of psychopathology.},

Here, we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell-type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes, and leverages genome-wide information. Our results include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits; a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers; and many cell-type-specific enrichments including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment, and smoking behavior.},

PARTICIPANTS An independent panel of 24 scientists and clinicians selected by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on behalf of the U.S. Public Health Service. A consortium of eight governmental and nonprofit organizations sponsored the update. EVIDENCE Approximately 8700 English-language, peer-reviewed articles and abstracts, published between 1975 and 2007, were reviewed for data that addressed assessment and treatment of tobacco dependence. This literature served as the basis for more than 35 meta-analyses. CONSENSUS PROCESS Two panel meetings and numerous conference calls and staff meetings were held to evaluate meta-analyses and relevant literature, to synthesize the results, and to develop recommendations. The updated guideline was then externally reviewed by more than 90 experts, made available for public comment, and revised. CONCLUSIONS This evidence-based, updated guideline provides specific recommendations regarding brief and intensive tobacco-cessation interventions as well as system-level changes designed to promote the assessment and treatment of tobacco use. Brief clinical approaches for patients willing and unwilling to quit are described.},

Recent studies reported better effectiveness of varenicline in women and in nicotine normal metabolizers phenotypically determined by nicotine-metabolite ratio. Our objective was to study the influence of nicotine-metabolite ratio, CYP2A6 genotype and sex on the response to nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline. Data were extracted from a longitudinal study which included smokers participating in a smoking cessation program. Response to treatment was defined by the absence of relapse when a set threshold of reduction in cigarettes per day relative to the week before the study was no more reached. The analysis considered total and partial reduction defined by a diminution of 100\% and of 90\% in cigarettes per day, respectively. The hazard ratio of relapsing was estimated in multivariate Cox regression models including the sex and the nicotine metabolism determined by the phenotype or by CYP2A6 genotyping (rs1801272 and rs28399433). In the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping and in women, the hazard ratio for relapsing was significantly lower with varenicline for a partial decrease (HR = 0.33, 95\% CI [0.12, 0.89] and HR = 0.20, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.91], respectively) and nonsignificantly lower for a total cessation (HR = 0.45, 95\% CI [0.20, 1.0] and HR = 0.38, 95\% CI [0.14, 1.0]). When compared with the normal metabolizers determined by phenotyping, the hazard ratio for a partial decrease was similar in the normal metabolizers determined by genotyping (HR = 0.42, 95\% CI [0.18, 0.94]) while it was significantly lower with varenicline for a total cessation (HR = 0.50, 95\% CI [0.26, 0.98]). Women and normal nicotine metabolizers may benefit more from varenicline over nicotine replacement therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

A search of the English language literature from 1975 to 2005 using Medline and PsycInfo databases found 280 relevant articles. Ninety percent of the studies investigating gender differences in substance abuse treatment outcomes were published since 1990, and of those, over 40\% were published since the year 2000. Only 11.8\% of these studies were randomized clinical trials. A convergence of evidence suggests that women with substance use disorders are less likely, over the lifetime, to enter treatment compared to their male counterparts. Once in treatment, however, gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention, completion, or outcome. Gender-specific predictors of outcome do exist, however, and individual characteristics and treatment approaches can differentially affect outcomes by gender. While women-only treatment is not necessarily more effective than mixed-gender treatment, some greater effectiveness has been demonstrated by treatments that address problems more common to substance-abusing women or that are designed for specific subgroups of this population. There is a need to develop and test effective treatments for specific subgroups such as older women with substance use disorders, as well as those with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders. Future research on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gender-specific versus standard treatments, as well as identification of the characteristics of women and men who can benefit from mixed-gender versus single-gender treatments, would advance the field.},

However, little is known about cigarette use among justice-involved youth, especially youth supervised in the community where there is ample opportunity to smoke. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the associations between cigarette smoking, emotional and behavioral functioning, and other substance use among a sample of first-time offending court-involved, non-incarcerated (FTO-CINI) youth. Methods: Youth were recruited from a family court in the Northeast (N = 423). Substance use was self-reported using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA). Emotional and behavioral functioning was measured using the Behavior Assessment Schedule for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2), the Affect Dysregulation Scale (ADS), National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS), and the National Survey of Self-Reported Delinquency (NYS-SRD). Results: About 9.9\% of FTO-CINI youth had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. Compared with FTO-CINI youth who had not smoked recently, recent smokers endorsed more emotional and behavioral symptoms, such as school problems (p {$<$} .001), internalizing problems (p = .012), inattention/hyperactivity (p = .020), affect dysregulation (p = .044), PTSD symptoms (p = .006), and delinquent behavior (p {$<$} .001). Recent smokers were also more likely to use alcohol (OR = 5.61, p {$<$} .001), marijuana (OR = 11.27, p {$<$} .001), and other drugs (OR = 5.00, p {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Recent smoking was higher among FTO-CINI youth than youth in the general population. Findings underscore the need to incorporate nicotine into existing substance use prevention interventions for this population, who are at high risk to initiate cigarette use as they age.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nicotine dependence is a chronic disorder often characterized by multiple failed quit attempts (QAs). Yet, little is known about the sequence of methods used across multiple QAs or how this may impact future ability to abstain from smoking. This prospective cohort study examines the effectiveness of switching smoking-cessation medications (SCMs) across multiple QAs. METHODS: Adult smokers (aged {$\geq$}18 years) participating in International Tobacco Control surveys in the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada, and Australia (N=795) who: (1) completed two consecutive surveys between 2006 and 2011; (2) initiated a QA at least 1 month before each survey; and (3) provided data for the primary predictor (SCM use during most recent QA), outcome (1-month point prevalence abstinence), and relevant covariates. Analyses were conducted in 2016. RESULTS: Five SCM user classifications were identified: (1) non-users (43.5\%); (2) early users (SCM used for initial, but not subsequent QA; 11.4\%); (3) later users (SCM used for subsequent, but not initial QA; 18.4\%); (4) repeaters (same SCM used for both QAs; 10.7\%); and (5) switchers (different SCM used for each QA; 14.2\%). Abstinence rates were lower for non-users (15.9\%, OR=0.48, p=0.002), early users (16.6\%, OR=0.27, p=0.03), and repeaters (12.4\%, OR=0.36, p=0.004) relative to switchers (28.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest smokers will be more successful if they use a SCM in QAs and vary the SCM they use across time. That smokers can increase their odds of quitting by switching SCMs is an important message that could be communicated to smokers.},

  abstract = {Background:               New methods such as machine learning techniques have been increasingly used to enhance the performance of risk predictions for clinical decision-making. However, commonly reported performance metrics may not be sufficient to capture the advantages of these newly proposed models for their adoption by health care professionals to improve care. Machine learning models often improve risk estimation for certain subpopulations that may be missed by these metrics.                                         Methods and Results:               This article addresses the limitations of commonly reported metrics for performance comparison and proposes additional metrics. Our discussions cover metrics related to overall performance, discrimination, calibration, resolution, reclassification, and model implementation. Models for predicting acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention are used to illustrate the use of these metrics.                                         Conclusions:               We demonstrate that commonly reported metrics may not have sufficient sensitivity to identify improvement of machine learning models and propose the use of a comprehensive list of performance metrics for reporting and comparing clinical risk prediction models.},

No treatment was provided.Most smokers (60\%) made multiple transitions among smoking, reduction, and abstinence. Intention to not smoke or quit often did not result in a quit attempt but were still strong predictors of a quit attempt and eventual abstinence. Most quit attempts (79\%) lasted less than 1 day; about one fifth (18\%) of the participants were abstinent at 12 weeks. The majority of quit attempts (72\%) were not preceded by an intention to quit. Such quit attempts were shorter than quit attempts preceded by an intention to quit (\&lt;1 day vs. 25 days). Most smokers (67\%) used a treatment, and use of a treatment was nonsignificantly associated with greater abstinence (14 days vs. 3 days). Making a quit attempt and failing early predicted an increased probability of a later quit attempt compared to not making a quit attempt early (86\% vs. 67\%). Smokers often (17\%) failed to report brief quit attempts on an end-of-study survey.Cessation is a more chronic, complex, and dynamic process than many theories or treatments assume.},

Accurate prediction models will have great impacts on both disease prevention and early treatment strategies. Despite the identification of thousands of disease-associated genetic variants through genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk prediction accuracy remains moderate for most diseases, which is largely due to the challenges in both identifying all the functionally relevant variants and accurately estimating their effect sizes in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper, we introduce AnnoPred, a principled framework that leverages diverse types of genomic and epigenomic functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for complex diseases. AnnoPred is trained using GWAS summary statistics in a Bayesian framework in which we explicitly model various functional annotations and allow for linkage disequilibrium estimated from reference genotype data. Compared with state-of-the-art risk prediction methods, AnnoPred achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy in both extensive simulations and real data.},

Machine learning (ML) is becoming more prevalent for smoking cessation success prediction in treatment programs. However, only individuals with an intention to quit smoking cigarettes participate in such programs, which limits the generalizability of the results. This study applies data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), a United States longitudinal nationally representative survey, to select primary determinants of smoking cessation and to train ML classification models for predicting smoking cessation among the general population. An analytical sample of 9,281 adult current established smokers from the PATH survey wave 1 was used to develop classification models to predict smoking cessation by wave 2. Random forest and gradient boosting machines were applied for variable selection, and the SHapley Additive explanation method was used to show the effect direction of the top-ranked variables. The final model predicted wave 2 smoking cessation for current established smokers in wave 1 with an accuracy of 72\% in the test dataset. The validation results showed that a similar model could predict wave 3 smoking cessation of wave 2 smokers with an accuracy of 70\%. Our analysis indicated that more past 30 days e-cigarette use at the time of quitting, fewer past 30 days cigarette use before quitting, ages older than 18 at smoking initiation, fewer years of smoking, poly tobacco past 30-days use before quitting, and higher BMI resulted in higher chances of cigarette cessation for adult smokers in the US.},

Although more than 70\% of smokers express a desire to quit, fewer than 3\% remain abstinent for more than one year, highlighting a critical need for more efficacious smoking cessation treatments. Areas Covered: The authors discuss the rationale, preclinical and clinical development of varenicline for smoking cessation. They cover the formulation of varenicline as a partial agonist at {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}2 receptors, the primary neural substrate for nicotine reward. Then, they discuss evidence from preclinical studies indicating varenicline's efficacy in blocking nicotine reward, followed by clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in sustaining abstinence in smokers. Finally, they cover post-market surveillance, including contraindications in heavy machine operators, putative cardiovascular risk, and the repealed warning for adverse neuropsychiatric events. Expert opinion: Varenicline development was based on strong theoretical rationale and preclinical evidence. Clinical studies indicate that varenicline is safe and more effective in sustaining abstinence than placebo, bupropion or nicotine replacement therapies. However, given that continuous abstinence rates across studies remain low (18{\textasciitilde}30\% with varenicline; 4{\textasciitilde}10\% with placebo), novel and more effective medications targeting other nicotinic or glutamate receptors for smoking cessation are required.},

Replication of this relationship in community-based samples of treatment-seeking smokers may help guide the implementation of the NMR for personalized treatment for nicotine dependence. Methods Data from a community-based sample of treatment seeking smokers (N=499) who received 8weeks of transdermal nicotine and 4 behavioral counseling sessions were used to evaluate associations between the NMR and smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes included withdrawal and craving, depression and anxiety, side effects, and treatment adherence. Results The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR=.56, 95\% CI: 0.33-0.95, p=.03), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates than slower metabolizers (24\% vs. 33\%). Faster nicotine metabolizers exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms over time during treatment, vs. slower metabolizers (NMR x Time interaction: F[3,357]=3.29, p=.02). NMR was not associated with changes in withdrawal, craving, depression, side effects, and treatment adherence (p's{$>$}.05). Conclusions In a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers, faster nicotine metabolizers were significantly less likely to quit smoking and showed higher rates of anxiety symptoms during a smoking cessation treatment program, vs. slower nicotine metabolizers. These results provide further evidence that transdermal nicotine is less effective for faster nicotine metabolizers and suggest the need to address cessation-induced anxiety symptoms among these smokers to increase the chances for successful smoking cessation.},

Varenicline may affect mechanisms and clinical outcomes that are relevant for both smoking cessation and alcohol use. The current study examines whether varenicline, relative to nicotine replacement therapy, yields better smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinking smokers. Method: Secondary data analyses of a comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of three smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (12 weeks of varenicline, nicotine patch, or nicotine patch and lozenge) paired with six counseling sessions were conducted. Adult daily cigarette smokers (N = 1,078, 52\% female) reported patterns of alcohol use, cigarette craving, and alcohol-related cigarette craving at baseline and over 4 weeks after quitting. Smoking cessation outcome was 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Results: Binge drinkers had higher relapse rates than moderate drinkers at 4-week post-target quit day but not at the end of treatment or long-term follow up (12 and 26 weeks). Varenicline did not yield superior smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinkers, nor did it affect alcohol use early in the quit attempt. Varenicline did produce relatively large reductions in alcohol-related cigarette craving and overall cigarette craving during the first 4 weeks after quitting. Conclusions: Varenicline did not yield higher smoking abstinence rates or reduce alcohol use among binge drinkers. Varenicline did reduce alcohol-related cigarette craving but this did not translate to meaningful differences in smoking abstinence. Varenicline's effects on smoking abstinence do not appear to vary significantly as a function of drinking status.},

Additionally, the study examined rates of other potentially modifiable health risk factors for the development of CVD and cancer. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional survey was completed by participants attending Australian Salvation Army residential substance abuse treatment services (n = 228). Rates of smoking, exercise, dietary fat intake, body mass index and depression were identified and compared with representative community populations. The relationship between length of treatment and changes in these variables was also examined. Results. When compared with the Australian population, participants were much more likely to be current smokers. They also showed higher rates of dietary fat intake, and having had a previous diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Encouragingly, participants were more likely to be engaging in regular exercise. Over a third of all smokers reported having increased their smoking since attending the residential program, with correlational analysis suggesting that nicotine dependence was increasing the longer participants were in treatment. Discussion and Conclusions. People attending substance abuse treatment show extremely high rates of smoking (77\%). With the large majority of participants showing multiple risk factors for CVD, it is important that residential services consider strategies to address smoking and the other potentially modifiable health risk factors in an integrated fashion.[Kelly PJ, Baker AL, Deane FP, Kay-Lambkin FJ, Bonevski B, Tregarthen J.

  abstract = {Clinical trials have identified numerous prescriptive predictors of mental disorder treatment response, ie, predictors of which treatments are best for which patients. However, none of these prescriptive predictors is strong enough alone to guide precision treatment planning. This has prompted growing interest in developing precision treatment rules (PTRs) that combine information across multiple prescriptive predictors, but this work has been much less successful in psychiatry than some other areas of medicine. Study designs and analysis schemes used in research on PTR development in other areas of medicine are reviewed, key challenges for implementing similar studies of mental disorders are highlighted, and recent methodological advances to address these challenges are described here.Discovering prescriptive predictors requires large samples. Three approaches have been used in other areas of medicine to do this: conduct very large randomized clinical trials, pool individual-level results across multiple smaller randomized clinical trials, and develop preliminary PTRs in large observational treatment samples that are then tested in smaller randomized clinical trials. The third approach is most feasible for research on mental disorders. This approach requires working with large real-world observational electronic health record databases; carefully selecting samples to emulate trials; extracting information about prescriptive predictors from electronic health records along with other inexpensive data augmentation strategies; estimating preliminary PTRs in the observational data using appropriate methods; implementing pragmatic trials to validate the preliminary PTRs; and iterating between subsequent observational studies and quality improvement pragmatic trials to refine and expand the PTRs. New statistical methods exist to address the methodological challenges of implementing this approach.Advances in pragmatic precision psychiatry will require moving beyond the current focus on randomized clinical trials and adopting an iterative discovery-confirmation process that integrates observational and experimental studies in real-world clinical populations.},

It is not known how often commercially insured adults obtain follow-up treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose.To investigate the incidence of follow-up treatment following emergency department discharge after nonfatal opioid overdose and patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims database for a large US commercial insurer, from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2019, to September 26, 2019. Adult patients discharged from the emergency department after an index opioid overdose (no overdose in the preceding 90 days) were included. Patients with cancer and without continuous insurance enrollment were excluded.The primary outcome was follow-up treatment in the 90 days following overdose, defined as a combined outcome of claims for treatment encounters or medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine and naltrexone). Analysis was stratified by whether patients received treatment for opioid use disorder in the 90 days before the overdose. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment. Marginal effects were used to report the average adjusted probability and absolute risk differences (ARDs) in follow-up for different patient characteristics.A total of 6451 patients were identified with nonfatal opioid overdose; the mean (SD) age was 45.0 (19.3) years, 3267 were women (50.6\%), and 4676 patients (72.5\%) reported their race as non-Hispanic white. A total of 1069 patients (16.6\%; 95\% CI, 15.7\%-17.5\%) obtained follow-up treatment within 90 days after the overdose. In adjusted analysis of patients who did not receive treatment before the overdose, black patients were half as likely to obtain follow-up compared with non-Hispanic white patients (ARD, -5.9\%; 95\% CI, -8.6\% to -3.6\%). Women (ARD, -1.7\%; 95\% CI, -3.3\% to -0.5\%) and Hispanic patients (ARD, -3.5\%; 95\% CI, -6.1\% to -0.9\%) were also less likely to obtain follow-up. For each additional year of age, patients were 0.2\% less likely to obtain follow-up (95\% CI, -0.3\% to -0.1\%).Efforts to improve the low rate of timely follow-up treatment following opioid overdose may seek to address sex, race/ethnicity, and age disparities.},

One of the most commonly used measures, the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP), has been adapted and evaluated in several specific populations, but evidence of its reliability and validity across broader samples of persons with substance use disorders is needed. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a revised version of the SIP (SIP-R) in a large combined sample of alcohol and drug use disorder treatment-seekers, with participants pooled from two national, multisite randomized clinical trials. A total of 886 participants across 10 outpatient treatment facilities completed a common assessment battery that included the SIP-R, Addiction Severity Index (ASI), University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), HIV Risk Behavior Scale (HRBS), and a substance use calendar. Results supported the SIP-R's internal reliability ({$\alpha$}=.95). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the hypothesized 5-factor model with one higher-order factor produced the best fit. Convergent validity was evident through the SIP-R's correlation with several composite scores from the ASI and the URICA, and analyses supported its conceptual distinction from quantity indices of drug/alcohol use. The SIP-R also demonstrated an ability to predict treatment retention, with higher scores associated with poorer retention. These results provide support for the SIP-R's psychometric properties as a measure of consequences across a broad sample of treatment-seeking drug and alcohol users.},

  abstract = {Background: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or ``moderators'') may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. Objective: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. Methods: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. Results: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (``drink,'' ``relapse,'' ``depression,'' and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88\% sensitivity and 82\% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery. Conclusions: Differences in language use can distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive issues.

  abstract = {Background and aims Precision, personalized or stratified medicine, which promises to deliver the right treatment to the right patient, is a topic of international interest in both the lay press and the scientific literature. A key aspect of precision medicine is the identification of biomarkers that predict the response to medications (i.e. pharmacogenetics). We examined why, despite the great strides that have been made in biomarker identification in many areas of medicine, only in oncology has there been substantial progress in their clinical implementation. We also considered why progress in this effort has lagged in addiction medicine. Methods We compared the development of pharmacogenetic biomarkers in oncology, cardiovascular medicine (where developments are also promising) and addictive disorders. Results The first major reason for the success of oncologic pharmacogenetics is ready access to tumor tissue, which allows in-vitro testing and insights into cancer biology. The second major reason is funding, with cancer research receiving, by far, the largest allocation by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) during the past two decades. The second largest allocation of research funding has gone to cardiovascular disease research. Addictions research received a much smaller NIH funding allocation, despite the major impact that tobacco use, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use have on the public health and healthcare costs. Conclusions Greater support for research on the personalized treatment of addictive disorders can be expected to yield disproportionately large benefits to the public health and substantial reductions in healthcare costs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

  abstract = {Background We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. Methods We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. Results We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. Conclusions We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.

We adopted the ANN model which reached a slightly better performance, with a sensitivity of 0.704, a specificity of 0.567, an accuracy of 0.640, and an ROC value of 0.660 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.617--0.702) for prediction in smoking cessation outcome. A predictive model for smoking cessation was constructed. The model could aid in providing the predicted success rate for all smokers. It also had the potential to achieve personalized and precision medicine for treatment of smoking cessation.},

  abstract = {Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely confront treatment teams. Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations. Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substantial variability exists in therapeutic response and adverse effects with pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence. Biomarkers to optimise treatment choice for individual smokers might improve treatment outcomes. We tested whether a genetically informed biomarker of nicotine clearance, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3'-hydroxycotinine:cotinine), predicts response to nicotine patch or varenicline for smoking cessation. METHODS: We undertook NMR-stratified multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial from Nov 16, 2010, to Sept 12, 2014, at four sites. Smokers seeking treatment were randomly assigned by baseline NMR status and study site, in blocks of 12 patients (1:1:1 ratio), to 11 weeks of placebo (placebo pill plus placebo patch), nicotine patch (active patch plus placebo pill), or varenicline (active pill plus placebo patch), plus behavioural counselling. Participants and investigators were masked to group allocation and NMR status. An intention-to-treat analysis was done. Participants were followed up for 12 months after the target quit date. The primary endpoint was biochemically verified 7 day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment to estimate the pharmacological effect of treatment by NMR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01314001. FINDINGS: 1246 participants (662 slow metabolisers of nicotine, 584 normal metabolisers of nicotine) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three interventions (408 placebo, 418 nicotine patch, 420 varenicline). At end of treatment, varenicline was more efficacious than nicotine patch in normal metabolisers (OR 2{$\cdot$}17, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}38-3{$\cdot$}42; p=0{$\cdot$}001), but not in slow metabolisers (OR 1{$\cdot$}13, 0{$\cdot$}74-1{$\cdot$}71; p=0{$\cdot$}56). In the longitudinal model including all timepoints, the NMR-by-treatment interaction was significant (ratio of odds ratios [ORR] 1{$\cdot$}96, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}11-3{$\cdot$}46; p=0{$\cdot$}02). An NMR-by-treatment interaction showed that slow (vs normal) metabolisers reported greater overall side-effect severity with varenicline versus placebo ({$\beta$}=-1{$\cdot$}06, 95\% CI -2{$\cdot$}08 to -0{$\cdot$}03; p=0{$\cdot$}044). INTERPRETATION: Treating normal metabolisers with varenicline and slow metabolisers with nicotine patch could optimise quit rates while minimising side-effects.

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

ADHD is more prevalent in patients with substance use disorders, and this pattern is consistent across different substances of abuse. Individuals with SUDs and ADHD exhibit significant variations in their clinical presentations. The developmental trajectory of ADHD to SUDs is complex: ADHD symptoms appear first in some patients but not in others. Many patients present with a heterogeneous collection of psychiatric and substance use co-morbidities, and these symptoms change over time. ADHD symptom severity is also highly variable, and more severe ADHD symptoms worsen co-morbid SUDs and complicate treatment. New longitudinal studies with innovative methods in high-risk populations and in community-based samples may clarify issues related to patient-treatment matching. When closely monitored, psychostimulant and other adjunct medications can be safely used to treat ADHD in this population, and such treatment may also improve outcome of SUDs. In particular, emerging evidence suggests individual-level tailoring ("precision medicine") approaches may represent a key pathway to improve clinical outcome.},

With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine's multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease. This review focuses on machine learning utilization for precision medicine's ``big data'', in the context of genetics, genomics, and beyond.},

However, as far as we know, there is a lack of screening of variables related to the success of therapeutic intervention (STI) in Brazilian smokers by machine learning (ML) algorithms. To address this gap in the literature, we evaluated the ability of eight ML algorithms to correctly predict the STI in Brazilian smokers who were treated at a smoking cessation program in Brazil between 2006 and 2017. The dataset was composed of 12 variables and the efficacies of the algorithms were measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We plotted a decision tree flowchart and also measured the odds ratio (OR) between each independent variable and the outcome, and the importance of the variable for the best model based on PPV. The mean global values for the metrics described above were, respectively, 0.675{\textpm}0.028, 0.803{\textpm}0.078, 0.485{\textpm}0.146, 0.705{\textpm}0.035 and 0.680{\textpm}0.033. Supporting vector machines performed the best algorithm with a PPV of 0.726{\textpm}0.031. Smoking cessation drug use was the roof of decision tree with OR of 4.42 and importance of variable of 100.00. Increase in the number of relapses also promoted a positive outcome, while higher consumption of cigarettes resulted in the opposite. In summary, the best model predicted 72.6\% of positive outcomes correctly. Smoking cessation drug use and higher number of relapses contributed to quit smoking, while higher consumption of cigarettes showed the opposite effect. There are important strategies to reduce the number of smokers and increase STI by increasing services and drug treatment for smokers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have yielded significant advances in the understanding of neural processes relevant to the development and persistence of addiction. However, these advances have not explored extensively for diagnostic accuracy in human subjects. The aim of this study was to develop a statistical approach, using a machine learning framework, to correctly classify brain images of cocaine-dependent participants and healthy controls. In this study, a framework suitable for educing potential brain regions that differed between the two groups was developed and implemented. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) images obtained during rest or a saline infusion in three cohorts of 2-4 week abstinent cocaine-dependent participants (n\,=\,93) and healthy controls (n\,=\,69) were used to develop a classification model. An information theoretic-based feature selection algorithm was first conducted to reduce the number of voxels. A density-based clustering algorithm was then used to form spatially connected voxel clouds in three-dimensional space. A statistical classifier, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), was then used for participant classification. Statistically insignificant voxels of spatially connected brain regions were removed iteratively and classification accuracy was reported through the iterations. RESULTS: The voxel-based analysis identified 1,500 spatially connected voxels in 30 distinct clusters after a grid search in SVM parameters. Participants were successfully classified with 0.88 and 0.89~F-measure accuracies in 10-fold cross validation (10xCV) and leave-one-out (LOO) approaches, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.90 and 0.89 for LOO; 0.83 and 0.83 for 10xCV. Many of the 30 selected clusters are highly relevant to the addictive process, including regions relevant to cognitive control, default mode network related self-referential thought, behavioral inhibition, and contextual memories. Relative hyperactivity and hypoactivity of regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions in cocaine-dependent participants are presented with corresponding level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: The SVM-based approach successfully classified cocaine-dependent and healthy control participants using voxels selected with information theoretic-based and statistical methods from participants' SPECT data. The regions found in this study align with brain regions reported in the literature. These findings support the future use of brain imaging and SVM-based classifier in the diagnosis of substance use disorders and furthering an understanding of their underlying pathology.},

  abstract = {The digital world is generating data at a staggering and still increasing rate. While these `Big Data' have unlocked novel opportunities to understand public health, they hold still greater potential for research and practice. This review explores several key issues arising around big data. First, we propose a taxonomy of sources of big data in order to clarify terminology and identify threads common across some subtypes of big data. Next, we consider common public health research and practice uses for big data, including surveillance, hypothesis-generating research, and causal inference, while exploring the role that machine learning may play in each use. We then consider the ethical implications of the big data revolution with particular emphasis on maintaining appropriate care for privacy in a world in which technology is rapidly changing social norms regarding the need for (and even the meaning of) privacy. Finally, we make suggestions regarding structuring teams and training to succeed in working with big data in research and practice.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. Design A scoping review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. Eligibility criteria We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. Data extraction and synthesis We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. Results Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74\%) and China (n=40, 17.32\%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52\%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16\,543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5\%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2\%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42\%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52\%). Conclusions Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although sleep apnea is common, it often goes undiagnosed in primary care encounters. OBJECTIVE: To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. DESIGN: Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. SETTING: Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. PATIENTS: 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74\%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. MEASUREMENTS: Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). RESULTS: Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5\%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79. CONCLUSION: The Berlin Questionnaire provides a means of identifying patients who are likely to have sleep apnea.},

  abstract = {Introduction Although health coverage facilitates service access to adults in the general population, uncertainty exists over the extent to which this relationship extends to low-income adults with substance use disorders. Methods The health status and service use patterns of low-income adults with substance use disorders who had continuous, discontinuous, and no past year health coverage were compared using data from the 2015--2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population. Results In the weighted sample (unweighted n~=~9243), approximately 65.66\% of low-income adults with substance use disorders had continuous coverage, 17.03\% had discontinuous coverage, and 17.31\% had no insurance coverage during the past year. Although few group differences were observed in self-reported health status, the uninsured group compared to the discontinously and continuously covered groups, respectively, was less likely to report a past year substance use treatment visit (11.03\% vs. 14.83\% vs. 15.61\%), an outpatient care visit (53.39\% vs. 71.27\% vs. 79.04\%), an emergency department visit (33.33\% vs. 45.76\% vs. 45.57\%), or an inpatient admission (9.24\% vs. 15.11\% vs. 15.58\%). Conclusions Although the cross sectional design limits causal inferences, the correlations between lacking health insurance and low rates of substance use treatment and healthcare use raise the possibility that increasing healthcare coverage might increase access to substance use treatment and other needed healthcare services for low-income adults with substance use disorders.},

Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines.

When these drugs were introduced into the clinic, the specific targets affected in human tumors were unknown. In April 2004, two groups reported that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are strongly associated with gefitinib sensitivity in patients with non--small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We subsequently extended these findings and showed that such mutations are also associated with sensitivity to erlotinib. Here, we present current knowledge about EGFR mutations in the context of clinical trials involving gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC. Design This article reviews the rationale for targeting EGFR, the development of gefitinib and erlotinib, the discovery of EGFR mutations, and subsequent studies to define the incidence, spectrum, and functions of EGFR mutations. Results The discovery of EGFR mutations promises to alter the ways in which we consider and treat NSCLC. Conclusion This information can guide practitioners and help them inform their patients about EGFR mutations and their impact on the treatment of NSCLC.}

We applied support vector machine-based classification to resting state functional connectivity data from nicotine-dependent smokers and healthy controls to identify brain-based features predictive of nicotine dependence. By employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in predicting smoking status. Our findings suggest that machine learning-based approaches to classifying resting state functional connectivity data offer a valuable alternative technique to understanding large-scale differences in addiction-related neurobiology.},

This study used data from 7 waves (2002--2009) of the International Tobacco Control 4-country cohort study to examine the role of smokers' quitting history (e.g., recency, length, and number of previous quit attempts) on their subsequent likelihood of making a quit attempt and achieving at least 6 months of sustained abstinence.Generalized estimating equations were used, allowing for estimation of relationships between variables across repeated observations while controlling for correlations from multiple responses by the same individual (29,682 observations from 13,417 individuals).The likelihood of a future quit attempt increased independently with recency and number of prior attempts. By contrast, the likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence of at least 6 months was reduced for smokers with a failed quit attempt within the last year (15.1\% vs. 27.1\% for those without, p \&lt; .001). Two or more failed attempts (vs. only one) in the previous year were also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving sustained abstinence (OR: 0.57, 95\% CI: 0.38--0.85). Effects persisted after controlling for levels of addiction, self-efficacy to quit, and use of stop-smoking medications.There appears to be a subset of smokers who repeatedly attempt but fail to remain abstinent from tobacco. Understanding why repeated attempts might be less successful in the long term is an important research priority because it implies a need to tailor treatment approaches for those who are motivated to quit but persistently relapse back to smoking.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smoking lapses after the quit date often lead to full relapse. To inform the development of real time, tailored lapse prevention support, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports. AIMS AND METHODS: We used data from app users with {$\geq$}20 unprompted data entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (eg, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample (1) observations and (2) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested. RESULTS: Participants (N = 791) provided 37 002 data entries (7.6\% lapses). The best-performing group-level algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.961 to 0.978). Its ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample individuals ranged from poor to excellent (AUC = 0.482-1.000). Individual-level algorithms could be constructed for 39/791 participants with sufficient data, with a median AUC of 0.938 (range: 0.518-1.000). Hybrid algorithms could be constructed for 184/791 participants and had a median AUC of 0.825 (range: 0.375-1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual's dataset, in addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of each individual's data, had improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. IMPLICATIONS: This study used routinely collected data from a popular smartphone app to train and test a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse events. Although a high-performing group-level algorithm was developed, it had variable performance when applied to new, unseen individuals. Individual-level and hybrid algorithms had somewhat greater performance but could not be constructed for all participants because of the lack of variability in the outcome measure. Triangulation of results with those from a prompted study design is recommended prior to intervention development, with real-world lapse prediction likely requiring a balance between unprompted and prompted app data.},

Methods Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n\,=\,12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity. Results Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted. Conclusions Findings highlight that Black-White and Latino-White disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment still persist. However, Black-White disparities may be limited to only those who are uninsured. Public health implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To identify promising intervention components intended to help smokers to attain and maintain abstinence in their quit smoking attempts. DESIGN: A fully crossed, six-factor randomized fractional factorial experiment. SETTING: Eleven primary care clinics in southern Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 637 adult smokers (55\% women, 88\% white) motivated to quit smoking who visited primary care clinics. INTERVENTIONS: Six intervention components designed to prepare smokers to quit, and achieve and maintain abstinence (i.e. for the preparation, cessation and maintenance phases of smoking treatment): (1) preparation nicotine patch versus none; (2) preparation nicotine gum versus none; (3) preparation counseling versus none; (4) intensive cessation in-person counseling versus minimal; (5) intensive cessation telephone counseling versus minimal; and (6) 16 versus 8\,weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch \,+\, nicotine gum). MEASUREMENTS: Seven-day self-reported point-prevalence abstinence at 16\,weeks. FINDINGS: Preparation counseling significantly improved week 16 abstinence rates (P = .04), while both forms of preparation nicotine replacement therapy interacted synergistically with intensive cessation in-person counseling (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conversely, intensive cessation phone counseling and intensive cessation in-person counseling interacted antagonistically (P\,{$<$}\,0.05)-these components produced higher abstinence rates by themselves than in combination. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation counseling and the combination of intensive cessation in-person counseling with preparation nicotine gum or patch are promising intervention components for smoking and should be evaluated as an integrated treatment package.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding how smoking cessation treatments exert their effects can inform treatment development and use. Factorial designs allow researchers to examine whether multiple intervention components affect hypothesized change mechanisms, and whether the affected mechanisms are related to cessation. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of smokers recruited during primary care visits (N=637, 55\% women, 87\% white) who were motivated to quit. Participants in this fractional factorial experiment were randomized to one level of each of six intervention factors: Prequit Nicotine Patch vs None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs None, Preparation Counseling vs None, Intensive In-Person Counseling vs Minimal, Intensive Phone Counseling vs Minimal, and 16 vs 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement (nicotine patch+nicotine gum). Data on putative mechanisms (e.g., medication use, withdrawal, self-efficacy) and smoking status were gathered using daily assessments and during follow-up assessment calls. RESULTS: Some intervention components influenced hypothesized mechanisms. Prequit Gum and Patch each reduced prequit smoking and enhanced prequit coping and self-efficacy. In-Person Counseling increased prequit motivation to quit, postquit self-efficacy, and postquit perceived intratreatment support. Withdrawal reduction and reduced prequit smoking produced the strongest effects on cessation. The significant effect of combining Prequit Gum and In-Person Counseling on 26-week abstinence was mediated by increased prequit self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This factorial experiment identified which putative treatment mechanisms were influenced by discrete intervention components and which mechanisms influenced cessation. Such information supports the combined use of prequit nicotine gum and intensive in-person counseling as cessation interventions that operate via increased prequit self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of tobacco use treatments that are effective for all smokers is critical to improving clinical and public health. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate multiple intervention components for possible inclusion in an optimized tobacco use treatment. Factorial experiments permit analyses of the influence of patient characteristics on main and interaction effects of multiple, relatively discrete, intervention components. This study examined whether person-factor and smoking characteristics moderated the main or interactive effects of intervention components on 26-week self-reported abstinence rates. METHODS: This fractional factorial experiment evaluated six smoking cessation intervention components among primary care patients (N=637): Prequit Nicotine Patch vs. None, Prequit Nicotine Gum vs. None, Preparation Counseling vs. None, Intensive Cessation In-Person Counseling vs. Minimal, Intensive Cessation Telephone Counseling vs. Minimal, and 16 vs. 8 Weeks of Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT; nicotine patch+nicotine gum). RESULTS: Both psychiatric history and smoking heaviness moderated intervention component effects. In comparison with participants with no self-reported history of a psychiatric disorder, those with a positive history showed better response to 16- vs. 8-weeks of combination NRT, but a poorer response to counseling interventions. Also, in contrast to light smokers, heavier smokers showed a poorer response to counseling interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy smokers and those with psychiatric histories demonstrated a differential response to intervention components. This research illustrates the use of factorial designs to examine the interactions between person characteristics and relatively discrete intervention components. Future research is needed to replicate these findings.},

It focuses on (1) the main effects of the three Project MATCH treatments, (2) the prognostic value of client attributes employed in the matching hypotheses, and (3) the attribute by treatment interaction effects. METHOD: Clients recruited from outpatient settings (n = 952) or from aftercare settings (n = 774) were randomized to one of the following treatments: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Alcohol consumption and psychosocial functioning during treatment were assessed at the end of the 12-week treatment phase. RESULTS: During the treatment phase, small but statistically significant differences among treatments were found only in the outpatient arm on measures of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Forty-one percent (41\%) of CBT and TSF clients were abstinent or drank moderately without alcohol-related consequences, compared with 28\% of MET clients. Tests of 10 a priori primary client-treatment matching hypotheses failed to find any interaction effects that had an impact on drinking throughout the treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: In the outpatient setting there appears to be a temporary advantage to assigning individuals to CBT or TSF rather than MET. When there is a need to quickly reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related consequences, it appears that CBT or TSF should be the treatment of choice.},

  abstract = {More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14\% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70\% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19\,488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2\% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6\% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8\%) than for bupropion (16.2\%) and the nicotine patch (15.7\%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4\%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.},

  abstract = {Background Patients under antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia commonly exhibit poor adherence to treatment, high rates of treatment discontinuation, and frequent treatment changes. The ETOS study aimed to identify the reasons leading physicians to decide to switch antipsychotic treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia and to evaluate the outcome of this switch. Methods ETOS was an observational 18-week (four visits) study in outpatients 18 to 65~years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition criteria at least 6~months prior to enrolment, who were initiated on a new antipsychotic monotherapy treatment within the 2~weeks prior to enrollment. A total of 574 patients were recruited by 87 hospital- and office-based physicians. Ethical approval was obtained prior to study initiation (NCT00999895). Results The final analysis included 568 patients, 39.0\,{\textpm}\,11.2~years old with mean disease duration of 11.7~years. The male-to-female ratio was 53:47. The main reason for switching antipsychotic treatment was lack of tolerability (n\,=\,369, 65.0\%), followed by lack of efficacy (n\,=\,249, 43.8\%). Following treatment switch, 87.9\% of patients (n\,=\,499) showed meaningful clinical benefit by achieving a Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit score of {$\leq$}4 at the final visit. By the end of the study, total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, Clinical Global Impression-Severity, and Simpson-Angus Scale scores demonstrated significant mean decreases of 31.69, 0.70, 1.14, and 11.30, respectively (all p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Treatment adherence remarkably improved. Conclusion In the ETOS study, switch of antipsychotic monotherapy for reasons relating to lack of efficacy and/or tolerability was associated with significantly improved clinical benefit and significant increase of patients' adherence to treatment.},

The process of smoking cessation comprises different pragmatically defined phases, and these can help guide smoking treatment development and evaluation.

Multiple effective treatments exist for some phases (Cessation), but not others (Relapse Recovery). A chronic care approach to treating smoking requires effective interventions for every phase, especially interventions that exert complementary effects both within and across phases, and that can be disseminated broadly and cost-effectively.},

This study tested if the relative effectiveness of varenicline and NRT is associated with NMR status in a natural treatment setting. A secondary aim was to test if this relationship is moderated by behavioural support. Design Prospective observational multi-centre study with 4-week and 52-week follow-up. Setting Nine English Stop Smoking Services (SSS). Participants Data came from 1556 smokers (aged {$\geq$} 16 years) attending SSS between March 2012 and March 2013. Interventions Participants received pharmacotherapy together with behavioural support. Measurements The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence at both follow-up times. Main explanatory variables were (1) NMR status [slow (NMR {$<$} 0.31, n = 451) versus normal (NMR {$\geq$} 0.31, n = 1105) metabolizers]; (2) pharmacotherapy (varenicline versus NRT) and (3) behavioural support (individual versus group-based treatment). Analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic, SSS, mental/physical health and smoking characteristics. Findings Of participants, 44.2\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 41.7--46.6\%] and 8.0\% (95\% CI = 6.8--9.5\%) were continuously abstinent at 4 and 52 weeks. Varenicline was more effective than NRT at 4 weeks (P {$<$} 0.001) but only marginally so at 52 weeks (P = 0.061). There was no or inclusive evidence that NMR status moderated relative efficacy of varenicline and NRT at 4- [P = 0.60, Bayes factor (BF) = 0.25] or 52-week follow-ups (P = 0.74, BF = 0.73). However, this relationship was moderated by behavioural support (p = 0.012): the relative benefit of varenicline over NRT at 52-week follow-up was greater in slow, not normal, metabolizers receiving group rather than individual support (P = 0.012). Conclusions In a real-world setting, the nicotine metabolite ratio status of treatment-seeking smokers does not appear to contribute substantially to the differential effectiveness of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in Stop Smoking Services, when both pharmacotherapy and behavioural support are self-selected.},

This review summarizes the evidence supporting the development of the NMR as a biomarker of individual differences in nicotine metabolism, the relationship between the NMR and smoking behavior, the clinical utility of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation, and the potential mechanisms that underlie the relationship between NMR and smoking cessation. We conclude with a call for additional research necessary to determine the ultimate benefits of using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation. These future directions include measurement and other methodologic considerations, disseminating this approach to at-risk subpopulations, expanding the NMR to evaluate its efficacy in predicting treatment responses to e-cigarettes and other noncigarette forms of nicotine, and implementation science including cost-effectiveness analyses.See all articles in this Special Collection Honoring Paul F.

Criterion validity was supported by significant negative associations with substance use coping but not enhancement motives. Study 2 (N=823), extended the results of the initial factor analysis, indicating that the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) contains four first-order factors, which are indicators of a single second-order general distress tolerance factor. Study 2 indicated that the DTS was stable over a 6-month interval and the DTS was prospectively associated with alcohol problems among men. In both studies, males reported significantly higher levels of distress tolerance than women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The 68-item Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68) is a theoretically derived measure of tobacco dependence consisting of 13 subscales measuring a variety of smoking motives. The WISDM-68 subscales have demonstrated good psychometric characteristics and have the potential to elucidate diverse nicotine dependence factors and mechanisms. The present research aimed to shorten the WISDM to reduce assessment burden while maintaining or enhancing its psychometric properties. METHODS Data from three independent samples (one longitudinal observational study and two randomized clinical trials) were used to select subscales and reduced sets of items in order to develop and test a brief version of the WISDM-68. The full-item and reduced-item versions of the WISDM were then compared in terms of reliability, validity, and model fit (via confirmatory factor analysis) in the three independent samples. RESULTS Thirty-one items were dropped from the WISDM, the Behavioral Choice-Melioration subscale was dropped, and the Negative and Positive Reinforcement subscales were consolidated. This resulted in a new WISDM short form (Brief WISDM) comprising 37 items that load onto 11 subscales. The psychometric properties of the reduced-item WISDM subscales were found to be comparable with the full-item subscales in terms of internal consistency, long-term stability, concurrent validity, predictive validity, and model fit. DISCUSSION These analyses provide good evidence that the 37-item Brief WISDM can be used in place of the original 68-item WISDM if researchers desire to reduce participant assessment burden.},

This study describes the psychometric development of a revised version of the 28-item Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS; ). Because the different contexts of use sometimes permit only brief assessment, this revision has produced both a brief and longer form using an updated pool of candidate items. For the revised WSWS2, a candidate pool of 37 items was developed to measure nine putative withdrawal constructs. The stem and wording of items were revised as was the response scale. Data for psychometric analyses were derived from three smoking cessation randomized clinical trials conducted at the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention. Dimensionality, internal consistency, and item characteristic analyses of the candidate items were conducted in a derivation sample to ascertain the factor structure and to identify items that could be used in the WSWS2 scales. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) of reduced item sets and factor structure were conducted in two validation samples along with reliability and validity analyses. Derivation and validation sample analyses yielded a longer version of the WSWS2 (WSWS2-L) with 19 items and six subscales (Craving, Negative Affect, Hunger, Sleep, Restlessness, and Concentration) and a brief 6-item version (WSWS2-B). In validation sample analyses, both the WSWS2-L and the WSWS2-B demonstrated good reliability and validity as well as good fit in CFAs. The WSWS2-L and WSWS2-B possess improved construct coverage, fewer items, and other enhancements relative to the WSWS.},

METHOD: A new scale was constructed from the responses of a large sample of the general population to a request to list six situations which afforded pleasure. The most frequent items were reviewed and those likely to be affected by cultural setting, age, or sex were removed. A pilot study led to an abbreviated scale of 14 items, covering four domains of pleasure response. This questionnaire was subjected to psychometric evaluation in new samples from the general population and psychiatric patients. RESULTS: The scale was found to have a score range that would distinguish a 'normal' from an 'abnormal' response. Validity and reliability were found to be satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: The new scale, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), is an instrument which may be recommended for psychopathological research.},

The current review aimed to: (i) estimate smoking prevalence in homeless populations; (ii) explore the efficacy of smoking cessation and smoking reduction interventions for homeless individuals; and (iii) describe the barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation and smoking reduction.MethodSystematic review of peer-reviewed research. Data sources included electronic academic databases. Search terms: `smoking' AND `homeless' AND `tobacco', including adult (18+ years) smokers accessing homeless support services.ResultsFifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 46 USA). Data could not be meta-analysed due to large methodological inconsistencies and the lack of randomised controlled trials. Smoking prevalence ranged from 57\% to 82\%. Although there was no clear evidence on which cessation methods work best, layered approaches with additions to usual care seemed to offer modest enhancements in quit rates. Key barriers to cessation exist around the priority of smoking, beliefs around negative impact on mental health and substance use, and environmental influences.ConclusionsHomeless smokers will benefit from layered interventions which support many of their competing needs. To best understand what works, future recommendations include the need for consensus on the reporting of cessation outcomes.},

The present study sought to apply statistical classification methods to idiographic time series data in order to identify person-specific predictors of future drinking-relevant behavior, affect, and cognitions in a college student sample. DESIGN: Participants were sent 8 mobile phone surveys per day for 15 days. Each survey assessed the number of drinks consumed since the previous survey, as well as positive affect, negative affect, alcohol craving, drinking expectancies, perceived alcohol consumption norms, impulsivity, and social and situational context. Each individual's data were split into training and testing sets, so that trained models could be validated using person-specific out-of-sample data. Elastic net regularization was used to select a subset of a set of 40 variables to be used to predict either alcohol consumption, craving, or wanting to drink, forward in time. SETTING: A west-coast university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three university students who had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. MEASUREMENTS: Mobile phone surveys. FINDINGS: Averaging across participants, accurate out-of-sample predictions of future drinking were made 76\% of the time. For craving, the mean out-of-sample R{$^2$} value was .27. For wanting to drink, the mean out-of-sample R{$^2$} value was .27. CONCLUSION: Using a person-specific constellation of psychosocial and temporal variables, it may be possible to accurately predict drinking behavior, affect, and cognitions before they occur.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successfully treating illicit drug use has become paramount, yet elusive. Devising specialized treatment interventions could increase positive outcomes, but it is necessary to identify risk factors of poor long-term outcomes to develop specialized, efficacious treatments. We investigated whether functional network connectivity (FNC) measures were predictive of substance abuse treatment completion using machine learning pattern classification of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. METHODS: Treatment-seeking stimulant- or heroin-dependent incarcerated participants (n~= 139; 89 women) volunteered for a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. Participants performed a response inhibition Go/NoGo functional magnetic resonance imaging task prior to onset of the substance abuse treatment. We tested whether FNC related to the anterior cingulate cortex would be predictive of those who would or would not complete a 12-week substance abuse treatment program. RESULTS: Machine learning pattern classification models using FNC between networks incorporating the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula predicted which individuals would (sensitivity: 81.31\%) or would not (specificity: 78.13\%) complete substance abuse treatment. FNC analyses predicted treatment completion above and beyond other clinical assessment measures, including age, sex, IQ, years of substance use, psychopathy, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and motivation for change. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant neural network connections predicted substance abuse treatment outcomes, which could illuminate new targets for developing interventions designed to reduce or eliminate substance use while facilitating long-term outcomes. This work represents the first application of machine-learning models of FNC analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to predict which substance abusers would or would not complete treatment.},

Subsequently developed multidimensional measures have unstable factor structures or measure only a subset of the most widely replicated factors.

Factorial validity of the ASI-3 was supported by confirmatory factor analyses of 6 replication samples, including nonclinical samples from the United States and Canada, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain (n=4,494) and a clinical sample from the United States and Canada (n=390).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Theoretically, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment that matches an individual's etiology and/or maintaining factors should be more effective than a treatment that does not directly address these factors. Impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking may contribute to the development and maintenance of SUDs, and are potential candidate variables for assigning patients to treatment. The goal is to identify whether current research can provide insight into which treatments may be most effective for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking, relative to other treatments. A secondary goal is to provide recommendations for personalizing SUD treatment based on etiology or maintaining factors. METHOD: This review summarizes clinical trials that speak to the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use disorders, based on pre-treatment impulsivity, sensation seeking, or related constructs. RESULTS: Few studies examine the differential effectiveness of two or more treatments for individuals high in impulsivity or sensation seeking. Very preliminary evidence suggests that contingency management may hold promise for individuals high in impulsivity. Pharmacological trials were under-represented in the current review, despite evidence that the effectiveness of some pharmacological interventions may be moderated by impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Potential reasons for slow rate of progress to date are provided. Given slow accumulation of evidence, an alternative method for personalizing treatment based on pre-treatment psychosocial factors, including impulsivity and sensation/reward seeking, is proposed. Future research may explore the role of contingency management for SUD among individuals with high pre-treatment impulsivity or sensation seeking. Finally, novel, technology-enhanced behavioral mechanisms are discussed as an adjunct to SUD treatment for these high-risk populations.},

The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance use through its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences between adolescents from two-parent families and those from single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families. Parental knowledge and peer substance were important mediators which largely accounted for variability in the prevalence of adolescent substance use by grade, race/ethnicity, and family structure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, it is possible that only certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to antidepressants. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anhedonia, and cognitive control deficits. METHODS: Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Five pre-treatment variables moderated treatment response. Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations of a 10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31\% of the sample would exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with sertraline relative to placebo. Although there were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can be identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model must be tested prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment selection. However, findings demonstrate the potential to improve individual outcomes through algorithm-guided treatment recommendations.},

  abstract = {With the development of empirically supported treatments over the decades, have youth psychotherapies grown stronger? To investigate, we examined changes over time in treatment effects for four frequently treated youth mental-health problems: anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct disorders. We used PubMed and PsycINFO to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published between January 1960 and May 2017 involving youths between the ages of 4 and 18 years. We also searched reviews and meta-analyses of youth psychotherapy research, followed reference trails in the reports we identified, and obtained additional studies identified by therapy researchers whom we contacted. We identified 453 RCTs (31,933 participants) spanning 53 years (1963-2016). Effect sizes for the problem-relevant outcome measures were synthesized via multilevel meta-analysis. We tracked temporal trends for each problem domain and then examined multiple study characteristics that might moderate those trends. Mean effect size increased nonsignificantly for anxiety, decreased nonsignificantly for ADHD, and decreased significantly for depression and conduct problems. Moderator analyses involving multiple study subgroups showed only a few exceptions to these surprising patterns. The findings suggest that new approaches to treatment design and intervention science may be needed, especially for depression and conduct problems. We suggest intensifying the search for mechanisms of change, making treatments more transdiagnostic and personalizable, embedding treatments within youth ecosystems, adapting treatments to the social and technological changes that alter youth dysfunction and treatment needs, and resisting old habits that can make treatments unduly skeuomorphic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs). METHODS: For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country, region, and year. We obtained disability weights from representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from cause of death estimates for 1980-2010 for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and present them with 95\% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183{$\cdot$}9 million DALYs (95\% UI 153{$\cdot$}5 million-216{$\cdot$}7 million), or 7{$\cdot$}4\% (6{$\cdot$}2-8{$\cdot$}6) of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8{$\cdot$}6 million YLLs (6{$\cdot$}5 million-12{$\cdot$}1 million; 0{$\cdot$}5\% [0{$\cdot$}4-0{$\cdot$}7] of all YLLs) and 175{$\cdot$}3 million YLDs (144{$\cdot$}5 million-207{$\cdot$}8 million; 22{$\cdot$}9\% [18{$\cdot$}6-27{$\cdot$}2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders accounted for 40{$\cdot$}5\% (31{$\cdot$}7-49{$\cdot$}2) of DALYs caused by mental and substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for 14{$\cdot$}6\% (11{$\cdot$}2-18{$\cdot$}4), illicit drug use disorders for 10{$\cdot$}9\% (8{$\cdot$}9-13{$\cdot$}2), alcohol use disorders for 9{$\cdot$}6\% (7{$\cdot$}7-11{$\cdot$}8), schizophrenia for 7{$\cdot$}4\% (5{$\cdot$}0-9{$\cdot$}8), bipolar disorder for 7{$\cdot$}0\% (4{$\cdot$}4-10{$\cdot$}3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4{$\cdot$}2\% (3{$\cdot$}2-5{$\cdot$}3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3{$\cdot$}4\% (2{$\cdot$}2-4{$\cdot$}7), and eating disorders for 1{$\cdot$}2\% (0{$\cdot$}9-1{$\cdot$}5). DALYs varied by age and sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in people aged 10-29 years. The burden of mental and substance use disorders increased by 37{$\cdot$}6\% between 1990 and 2010, which for most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing. INTERPRETATION: Despite the apparently small contribution of YLLs--with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of injuries under self-harm--our findings show the striking and growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of their contribution, improvement in population health is only possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders a public health priority.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the last 5 years. METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing heritability. FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic risk factors.},

  abstract = {Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50\% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87\% White and n=150, 97\% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants' choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5\%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6\%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9\%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P\&lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.},

  abstract = {We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51\% male; mean age = 41; 87\% White, 97\% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1--8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk.   General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.},

This intra-individual variability of relevant psychological states combined with the ``one day of a time'' nature of sustained abstinence warrant a day-to-day investigation of substance use recovery. This study examines day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use among 30 college students in 12-step recovery from drug and alcohol addictions. To account for individual variability in day-to-day process, it applies an idiographic approach. The sample of 20 males and 10 females (mean age = 21) was drawn from members of a collegiate recovery community at a large university. Data were collected with end-of-day data collections taking place over an average of 26.7 days. First-order vector autoregression models were fit to each individual predicting daily levels of substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use from the same three variables one day prior. Individual model results demonstrated substantial inter-individual differences in intra-individual recovery process. Based on estimates from individual models, cluster analyses were used to group individuals into two homogeneous subgroups. Group comparisons demonstrate distinct patterns in the day-to-day associations among substance use cravings, negative affect, and tobacco use, suggesting the importance of idiographic approaches to recovery management and that the potential value of focusing on negative affect or tobacco use as prevention targets depends on idiosyncratic processes.},
